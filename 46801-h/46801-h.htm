<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span><i>PREFACE</i></h2>
<p><i>Dorsetshire</i>, <i>the centre of the</i> &ldquo;<i>Hardy
Country</i>,&rdquo; <i>the home of the Wessex Novels</i>, <i>is a
land literally flowing with milk and honey</i>: <i>a land of
great dairies</i>, <i>of flowers and bees</i>, <i>of rural
industries</i>, <i>where rustic ways and speech and habits of
thought live long</i>, <i>and the kindlier virtues are not
forgotten in such stress of life as prevails in towns</i>: <i>a
land desirable for its own sweet self</i>, <i>where you may see
the beehives in cottage gardens and therefrom deduce that honey
of which I have spoken</i>, <i>and where that flow of milk is no
figure of speech</i>.&nbsp; <i>You may indeed hear the swish of
it in the milking pails at almost every turn of every
lane</i>.</p>
<p><i>Thatch survives in every village</i>, <i>as nowhere
else</i>, <i>and here quaint towns maintain their quaintness at
all odds</i>, <i>while elsewhere foolish folk seek to be&mdash;as
they phrase it</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>up to date</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>It is good</i>, <i>you think</i>, <i>who explore these
parts</i>, <i>to be out of date and reckless of all the tiresome
worries of modernity</i>.</p>
<p><i>Spring is good in Dorset</i>, <i>summer better</i>,
<i>autumn&mdash;when the kindly fruits of the earth are
ingathered and </i><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span><i>the smell of pomace is sweet in the mellow
air&mdash;best</i>.&nbsp; <i>Winter</i>?&nbsp; <i>Well</i>,
<i>frankly</i>, <i>I don&rsquo;t know</i>.</p>
<p><i>To all these natural advantages has been added in our
generation the romantic interest of Mr. Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s
novels of rural life and character</i>, <i>in which real places
are introduced with a lavish hand</i>.&nbsp; <i>The identity of
those places is easily resolved</i>; <i>and</i>, <i>that feat
performed</i>, <i>there is that compelling force in his genius
which inevitably</i>, <i>sooner or later</i>, <i>magnetically
draws those who have read</i>, <i>to see for themselves what
manner of places and what folk they must be in real life</i>,
<i>from whose characteristics such poignant tragedy</i>, <i>such
suave and admirable comedy</i>, <i>have been evolved</i>.&nbsp;
<i>I have many a time explored Egdon</i>, <i>and observed the
justness of the novelist&rsquo;s description of that sullen
waste</i>: <i>have traversed Blackmoor Vale</i>, <i>where</i>
&ldquo;<i>the fields are never brown and the springs never
dry</i>,&rdquo; <i>but where the roads&mdash;it is a
cyclist&rsquo;s criticism&mdash;are always shockingly bad</i>:
<i>in fine</i>, <i>have visited every literary landmark of the
Wessex Novels</i>.&nbsp; <i>If I have not found the rustics so
sprack-witted as they are in</i> <span class="smcap">The Return
of the Native</span> <i>and other stories&mdash;why</i>, <i>I
never expected so to find them</i>, <i>for I did not imagine the
novelist to be a reporter</i>.&nbsp; <i>But&mdash;this is in
testimony to the essential likeness to life of his women&mdash;I
know</i> &ldquo;<i>Bathsheba</i>&rdquo;; <i>only she is not a
farmer</i>, <i>nor in</i> &ldquo;<i>Do&rsquo;set</i>,&rdquo;
<i>and I have met</i> &ldquo;<i>Viviette</i>&rdquo; <i>and</i>
&ldquo;<i>Fancy</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>They were called by other
names</i>, <i>&rsquo;tis true</i>; <i>but they were</i>, <i>and
are</i>, <i>those distracting characters come to life</i>.</p>
<p><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span><i>A
word in conclusion</i>.&nbsp; <i>No attempt has here been made to
solemnly</i> &ldquo;<i>expound</i>&rdquo; <i>the
novelist</i>.&nbsp; <i>He</i>, <i>I take it</i>, <i>expounds
himself</i>.&nbsp; <i>Nor has it been thought necessary to
exclude places simply for the reason that they by some chance do
not find mention in the novels</i>.&nbsp; <i>These pages are</i>,
<i>in short</i>, <i>just an attempt to record impressions
received of a peculiarly beautiful and stimulating literary
country</i>, <i>and seek merely to reflect some of the joy of the
explorer and the enthusiasm of an ardent admirer of the
novelist</i>, <i>who here has given tongues to trees and a voice
to every wind</i>.</p>

I</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">PRELIMINARIES: THE
HARDY COUNTRY DEFINED; FAWLEY MAGNA; OXFORD</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the literary partition of
England, wherein the pilgrim may discover tracts definitely and
indissolubly dedicated to Dickens, to Tennyson, to Ingoldsby, and
many another, no province has been so thoroughly annexed or so
effectively occupied as that associated with the Wessex novels
written by Mr. Thomas Hardy.&nbsp; He holds Wessex in fee-simple,
to the exclusion of all others; and so richly topographical are
all those romances, that long ere sketch-maps showing his
literary occupancy of it were prepared and published in the
uniform edition of his works, there were those to whom the
identity of most of his scenes offered no manner of doubt.&nbsp;
By the circumstances of birth and of lifelong residence, the
&ldquo;Wessex&rdquo; of the novels has come to denote chiefly his
native county of Dorset, and in especial the neighbourhood of
Dorchester, the county town; but Mr. Hardy was early an
expansionist, and his outposts were long ago thrown forward, to
at last make his <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Wessex in the domain of letters almost coterminous with
that ancient kingdom of Saxon times, which included all England
south of the Thames and west of Sussex, with the exception of
Cornwall.&nbsp; The very excellent sketch-map prepared for the
definitive edition of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s works very clearly shows
the comparative density of the literary settlements he has
made.&nbsp; Glancing at it, you at once perceive that what he
chooses to term &ldquo;South Wessex&rdquo;&mdash;named in merely
matter-of-fact gazetteers Dorsetshire&mdash;is thickly studded
with names of his own mintage, unknown to guidebook or ordnance
map, and presently observe that the surrounding divisions of
Upper, North, Mid, Outer, and Lower Wessex&mdash;as who should
say Hampshire, Berkshire, Wilts, Somerset, and Devon&mdash;are,
to follow the simile already adopted, barely colonised.</p>
<p>His nearest frontier-post towards London is Castle Royal, to
be identified with none other than Windsor; while near by are
Gaymead (Theale), Aldbrickham (Reading), and Kennetbridge
(Newbury).&nbsp; In the midst of that same division of North
Wessex, or Berkshire, are marked Alfredston and Marygreen,
respectively the little town of Wantage, birthplace of Alfred the
Great, and the small village of Fawley Magna, placed on the
draughty skyline of the bare and shivery Berkshire downs.</p>
<p>Then, near the eastern border of Upper Wessex is Quartershot,
or Aldershot, and farther within its confines Stoke-Barehills, by
which name Basingstoke and the unclothed uplands partly
surrounding it are indicated.&nbsp; Its &ldquo;gaunt,
unattractive, ancient church&rdquo; is accurately imaged in a
phrase, and it is just as true that the most familiar object of
the <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>place is
&ldquo;its cemetery, standing among some picturesque
medi&aelig;val ruins beside the railway&rdquo;; for indeed
Basingstoke cemetery and the fine ruins of the chapel once
belonging to the religious who, piously by intent, but rather
blasphemously to shocked ears, styled themselves the
&ldquo;Brotherhood of the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; stand immediately
without the railway station.&nbsp; At Stoke-Barehills, Jude and
Sue, visiting the Agricultural Show, were observed by Arabella,
Jude&rsquo;s sometime wife, with some jealousy.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Finally, northernmost of all these transfigured outer
landmarks, is Christminster, the university town and city of
Oxford, whose literary name in these pages derives from the
cathedral of Christ <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>there.&nbsp; This remote corner of his kingdom is
especially and solely devoted to the grievous story of <i>Jude
the Obscure</i>, a pitiful tale of frustrated ambition,
originally published serially in <i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
under the much more captivating, if less descriptive, title of
<i>Hearts Insurgent</i>.&nbsp; The story opens at Fawley Magna,
to whose identity a clue is found in the name of Fawley given the
unhappy Jude.&nbsp; The village, we are told, was &ldquo;as
old-fashioned as it was small, and it rested in the lap of an
upland adjoining the undulating North Wessex downs.&nbsp; Old as
it was, however, the well-shaft was probably the only relic of
the local history that remained absolutely unchanged. . . .&nbsp;
Above all, the original church, hump-backed, wood-turreted and
quaintly hipped, had been taken down, and either cracked up into
heaps of road-metal in the lane, or utilised as pigsty walls,
garden-seats, guard-stones to fences, and rockeries in the
flower-beds of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; In place of it a tall new
building of German-Gothic design, unfamiliar to English eyes, had
been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain obliterator of
historic records who had run down from London and back in a
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who was that obliterator thus held up to
satire?&nbsp; Inquiries prove the church to have been rebuilt in
1866, and its architect to have been none other than G. E.
Street, R.A., than whom the middle Victorian period had no more
accomplished architect.&nbsp; Truly enough, its design is
something alien, but candour compels the admission that, however
detached from local traditions, it is really a very fine
building, and its designer quite undeserving of so slighting a
notice.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>From
Fawley the scene of Jude&rsquo;s tragedy changes to
Christminster, the Oxford of everyday commerce.&nbsp; Oft had he,
as a boy, seen from this vantage-point the faint radiance of its
lights reflected from the sky at night, twenty miles away.&nbsp;
His anticipations and disillusionments, his strong resolves and
stumblings by the way, over stumbling-blocks of his own and of
extraneous making, picture a strong character brought low, like
Samson by Delilah&mdash;cheated of scholarly ambition by the
guardians of learning, who open its gates only to wealth or
scholarships acquired by early opportunity.&nbsp; Take <i>Jude
the Obscure</i> as you will, it forms a somewhat serious
indictment of university procedure: &ldquo;They raise
pa&rsquo;sons there, like radishes in a bed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all
learning there&mdash;nothing but learning, except
religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jude sought learning there, and Holy
Orders, but never rose beyond his trade of stonemason, and, after
many fitful wanderings through Wessex, ends tragically at
Oxford.</p>
<p>Since <i>Jude the Obscure</i> was written Oxford has gained
another historic personality, none the less real than the great
figures of actual life who have trodden the pavements of its High
Street.&nbsp; You may follow all the innermost thoughts of that
mere character in a novel, and see fully exposed the springs that
produce his actions; and thus he is made seem more human than all
your Wolseys and great dignitaries, whose doings, smothered in
dust, and whose motives, buried deep beneath their own
subterfuges and the dark imaginings of historians with little but
ancient verbiage to rely upon, seem only the spasmodic,
involuntary capers of so many irresponsible jumping-jacks.&nbsp;
Nowadays, when I <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>think of Oxford, it is to recall poor Jude Fawley&rsquo;s
fascination by it, like the desire of the moth for the star, or
for the candle that eventually scorches its wings and leaves it
maimed and dying.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a city of light,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, not knowing (as how should he have known?) that the
light it emits is but the phosphorescent glow of decay.&nbsp; And
when I walk the High Street, &ldquo;the main street&mdash;that
ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t another like it in the world,&rdquo; it is not
of Newman or his fellow Tractarians I think, but of Jude the
stonemason, feeling with appreciative technical fingers the
mouldings and crumbling stones of its architecture.</p>
<p>In one novel, <i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i>, Mr. Hardy has made
an expedition far beyond the confines of his Wessex.&nbsp; Away
beyond &ldquo;Lower Wessex,&rdquo; or Devonshire&mdash;itself
scarce more than incidentally referred to in the whole course of
his writings&mdash;he takes the reader to the north coast of
Cornwall, the &ldquo;furthest westward of all those convenient
corners wherein I have ventured to erect my theatre for these
imperfect little dramas of country life and passions; and it lies
near to, or no great way beyond, the vague border of the Wessex
kingdom, on that side which, like the westering verge of modern
American settlements, was progressive and uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Castle Boterel&rdquo; he styles the stage of his
tragical story of <i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i>; a place to be found
on maps under the style and title of Boscastle.&nbsp; That tiny
port and harbour on the wildest part of a wild coast obtains its
name, in a manner familiar to all students of Cornish topography,
by a series of phonetic corruptions.&nbsp; Originally the site of
a castle owned by the Norman family of De Bottreaux, <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>its name has in
the course of centuries descended from that knightly designation
to that it now bears.&nbsp; Leland, four hundred years ago,
described the place as &ldquo;a very filthy Toun and il
kept,&rdquo; and probably had still in mind and in nostrils when
he wrote the scent of the fish-cellars and the fish-offal which
to this day go largely towards making up the bouquet of most of
the smaller Cornish fishing-ports.</p>
<p>Still, as in Leland&rsquo;s time, goes the little brook,
running down from the tremendously hilly background &ldquo;into
the Severn Se betwixt 2 Hylles,&rdquo; and still the harbour
remains, from the mariner&rsquo;s point of view, &ldquo;a pore
Havenet, of no certaine Salvegarde,&rdquo; winding, as it does,
in the shape of a double S, between gigantic rocky headlands, and
most difficult of approach or exit.&nbsp; It will thus be
guessed, and guessed rightly, that, although poor as a harbour,
Boscastle is a place of commanding picturesqueness.&nbsp; Its
Cornish atmosphere, too, confers upon it another
distinction.&nbsp; In the romantic mind of the novelist the
district is &ldquo;pre-eminently (for one person at least) the
region of dream and mystery.&nbsp; The ghostly birds, the
pall-like sea, the frothy wind, the eternal soliloquy of the
waters, the bloom, of dark purple cast, that seems to exhale from
the shoreward precipices, in themselves lend to the scene an
atmosphere like the twilight of a night vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is not always like that at Boscastle.&nbsp; There are
days of bright sunshine, when the sea is in colour something
between a sapphire and an opal, when the cliffs reveal unexpected
hues and the sands of Trebarrow&mdash;the &ldquo;Trebarwith
Strand&rdquo; of the novel&mdash;shine golden, in contrast with
the dark <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>slaty headland of Willapark Point&mdash;the &ldquo;cliff
without a name&rdquo; where Elfride, the owner of that pair of
blue eyes, saves the prig, Henry Knight, by the singular
expedient none other than the author of the Wessex novels would
have conceived.&nbsp; The average reader may perhaps be allowed
his opinion that it had been better for Elfride had she saved her
underclothing and allowed Knight to drop from his precarious
hand-hold on the cliff&rsquo;s edge into the sea below waiting
for him.</p>
<p>The town of &ldquo;St. Launce&rsquo;s&rdquo; mentioned in the
book is of course Launceston, and &ldquo;Endelstow&rdquo; is the
village of St. Juliot&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WINCHESTER: THE
ANCIENT CAPITAL OF WESSEX</p>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, to have done with these
preliminary triflings in the marches of the Hardy Country, let us
consider in what way the Londoner may best come to a
thoroughgoing exploration of this storied land.&nbsp; On all
counts&mdash;by force of easy access, and by its ancient
circumstance&mdash;Winchester is indicated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The city
of Wintoncester, that fine old city, afore-time capital of
Wessex,&rdquo; stands at the gate of this literary country and
hard by the confines of the New Forest, to which by tradition and
history it is closely akin.&nbsp; At one in feeling with that
hoary hunting preserve, it is itself modern in but little
measure, and loves to linger upon memories of the past.&nbsp;
Here the Saxon and the Norman are not merely historical counters
with which, to the ideas of unimaginative students, the dusty
game of history was played; but do, by the presence of their
works, make the least impressionable feel that they were
creatures of blood and fibre, strong to rule, to make and unmake
nations; groping darkly in superstition, without doubt, but
perceiving the light, distant and dim, and striving with all the
strength of their strong natures to win toward it.&nbsp; They
fought as sturdily for Christianity as they had <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>done for
paganism, and were not&mdash;it really seems necessary to insist
upon it&mdash;creatures of parchment and the wax of which seals
are sealed; but lived as human a life as ourselves, and loved and
hated, and despaired and triumphed, just as keenly, nay, with
perhaps even greater keenness, than any Edwardian liege of this
twentieth century.&nbsp; Still runs the Itchen, bright and clear
as when the Romans came and the Saxons followed, to be in their
turn ousted in governance by the Norman-French; and still,
although this England of ours be yet overlorded by the relics of
Norman domination, it is the broad-shouldered, level-headed,
stolid, and long-suffering Saxon who peoples Winchester and
Wessex, and in him that ancient kingdom, although unknown to
modern political geographies, survives.</p>
<p>Sweet and gracious city, I love you for old association and
for your intrinsic worth, alike.&nbsp; Changing, although ever so
slowly, with the years, your developments make, not as elsewhere,
for black bitterness of heart and vain regrets for the things of
sweet savour and good report, swept away into the dustheaps and
potsherds of &ldquo;progress,&rdquo; but for content and happy
assent.&nbsp; In these later years, for example, it has occurred
to Winchester to honour Alfred, the great Wessex king, warrior
and lawgiver, born at Wantage, warring over all southern England,
ruling at Winchester, dead at Faringdon in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 901, and buried here in a spot still
shown, in the long desecrated Hyde Abbey.&nbsp; That is a noble,
heroic-sized bronze effigy of him, erected in 1901, to
commemorate the millenary of this hero-king, and one in thorough
keeping with Winchester&rsquo;s ancient dignity.</p>

<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Near
by, where its imposing bulk is reared up against the giant
background of St. Giles&rsquo;s Hill, you may still see and hear
the Itchen rushing furiously under the old City Mill by Soke
Bridge, where dusty millers have ground corn for a thousand
years.&nbsp; Released from the mill-leat, the stream regains its
placid temper and wanders suavely along daisy-dappled meads to
St. Cross, and so at last to lose itself in Southampton Water;
still fishful all the way, as in the days of old Izaak Walton
himself, who lies in the south transept of the cathedral yonder,
and has a sanctified place in these liberal-minded times in a
tabernacle of the restored reredos, in the glorious company of
the apostles, the saints, kings and bishops, who form a very
mixed concourse in that remarkable structure.&nbsp; I fear that
if they were all brought to life and introduced to one another,
they would not form the happiest of families.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s as may be.&nbsp; From this vantage-point by
King Alfred&rsquo;s statue&mdash;or &ldquo;&AElig;lfred,&rdquo;
as the inscription learnedly has it, to the confusion of the
unscholarly&mdash;you may see, as described in Tess, &ldquo;the
sloping High Street, from the West Gateway to the medi&aelig;val
cross, and from the medi&aelig;val cross to the bridge&rdquo;;
but you can only make out a portion of the squat, low Norman
tower of the cathedral itself; for here, instead of being
beckoned afar by lofty spire, you have to seek that ancient fane,
and, diligently inquiring, at last find it.&nbsp; Best it is to
come to the cathedral by way of that aforesaid medi&aelig;val
cross in the High Street, hard by the curiously overhanging
penthouse shops, and under a low-browed entry, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>which, to the
astonishment of the stranger, instead of conducting into a
backyard, brings one into the cathedral close, a lovely parklike
space of trim lawns, ancient lime avenues, and noble old
residences of cathedral dignitaries with nothing to do and
exceedingly good salaries for doing it.&nbsp; It has been
remarked, with an innocent, childlike wonder, that some sixty per
cent. of the famous men whose careers are included in the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> were the sons of
clergymen.&nbsp; No wonder at all, I take it, in this, for it is
merely nature&rsquo;s compensating swing of the pendulum.&nbsp;
The parents, living a life of repose, have been storing up energy
for the use of their offspring, and thus our greatest
empire-makers and men of action, and some of our greatest
scoundrels too, have derived from beneath the benignant shadow of
the Church.</p>
<p>That squat, heavy Norman tower just now spoken of has a
history to its squatness&mdash;a history bound up with the
tragical death of Rufus.&nbsp; The grave of the Red King in the
cathedral forms the colophon of a tragical story whose inner
history has never been, and never will be, fully explained; but
by all the signs and portents that preceded the ruthless
king&rsquo;s death at Stoney Cross, where his heart was pierced
by the glanced arrow said to have been aimed at the wild red deer
by Walter Tyrrell, it should seem that the clergy were more
intimately connected with that &ldquo;accident&rdquo; than was
seemly, even in the revengeful and bloodstained ecclesiastics of
that time.&nbsp; It must not be forgotten that the king had
despoiled the Church and the Church&rsquo;s high dignitaries with
a thorough and <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>comprehensive spoliation, nor can it be blinked that
certain of them had denounced him and prophesied disaster with an
exactness of imagery possible only to those who had prepared the
fulfilment of their boding prophecies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even
now,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;the arrow of retribution is fixed,
the bow is stretched.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was not metaphor, merely:
they prophesied who had with certainty prepared fulfilment.&nbsp;
And when the thing was consummated and the body of the Red King
was buried in the choir beneath the original central tower, the
ruin in which that tower fell, seven years later, was not,
according to clerical opinion, due to faulty construction and the
insufficient support given to its great crushing weight by the
inadequate pillars, but to the fact that one was buried beneath
who had not received the last rites of the Church.&nbsp; If
indeed that be so, the mills of God certainly do grind
slowly.</p>
<p>For the rest, the cathedral is the longest in England.&nbsp;
Longer than Ely, longer than St. Albans, it measures from east to
west no less than 556 feet.&nbsp; As we read in the story of
<i>Lady Mottisfont</i>, Wintoncester, among all the romantic
towns in Wessex, is for this reason &ldquo;probably the most
convenient for meditative people to live in; since there you have
a cathedral with nave so long that it affords space in which to
walk and summon your remoter moods without continually turning on
your heel, or seeming to do more than take an afternoon stroll
under cover from the rain or sun.&nbsp; In an uninterrupted
course of nearly three hundred steps eastward, and again nearly
three hundred steps westward amid those magnificent tombs, you
can, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>for
instance, compare in the most leisurely way the dry dustiness
which ultimately pervades the persons of kings and bishops with
the damper dustiness that is usually the final shape of
commoners, curates, and others who take their last rest
out-of-doors.&nbsp; Then, if you are in love, you can, by
sauntering in the chapels and behind the episcopal chantries with
the bright-eyed one, so steep and mellow your ecstasy in the
solemnities around that it will assume a rarer and fairer
tincture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the city the curfew bell still rings out from the old
Guildhall every evening at eight o&rsquo;clock, the sentimental
survival of an old-time very real and earnest ordinance; the West
Gate remains in the wall, hard by the fragments of the royal
castle; down in the lower extremity of the city the
bishop&rsquo;s palace and castle of Wolvesey rears its shattered,
ivy-covered walls: much in fine remains of Winchester&rsquo;s
ancient state.</p>
<p>But now to make an end and to leave Winchester for
Salisbury.</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WINCHESTER TO
STOCKBRIDGE AND WEYHILL</p>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Wintoncester to
Melchester&mdash;that is to say, from Winchester to
Salisbury&mdash;is twenty-three miles if you go by way of
Stockbridge and Winterslow; if by the windings of the valley
roads by King&rsquo;s Somborne and Mottisfont, anything you like,
from thirty upwards, for it is a devious route and a
puzzling.&nbsp; We will therefore take the highway and for the
present leave the byways severely alone.</p>
<p>The high road goes in an ascent, a white and dusty streak,
from Winchester to Stockbridge, the monotonous undulations of the
chalky downs relieved here and there on the skyline by distant
woods, and the wayside varied at infrequent intervals by
murmurous coppices of pines, in whose sullen depths the riotous
winds lose themselves in hollow undertones or absolute
silences.&nbsp; But before the traveller comes thus out into the
country, he must, emerging from the West Gate, win to the open
through the recent suburb of Fulflood; for &ldquo;Winton&rdquo;
as its natives lovingly name it, and as the old milestones on
this very road agree to style it, has after many years of slumber
waked to life again, and is growing.&nbsp; It is not a large nor
a bustling suburb, this recent fringe upon Winchester&rsquo;s
ancient kirtle, <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>and you are soon out of it and breasting the slope of
Roebuck Hill.&nbsp; Here, looking back, the tragic outlines of
the prison, with grey-slated roof and ugly octagonal red-brick
tower, cut the horizon: an unlovely palimpsest set above the
medi&aelig;val graciousness of the ancient capital of all
England, but one that has become, in some sort, a literary
landmark in these later years, for it figures in the last scene
of <i>Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>.&nbsp; In the last
chapter of that strenuous romance you shall read how from the
western gate of the city two persons walked on a certain morning
with bowed heads and gait of grief.&nbsp; They were Angel Clare,
the husband, and &rsquo;Liza-Lu, the sister of poor Tess, come to
witness the hoisting of the black flag upon the tower of that
inimical building.&nbsp; They witnessed this proof that
&ldquo;&lsquo;Justice&rsquo; was done, and the President of the
Immortals (in &AElig;schylean phrase) had ended his sport with
Tess,&rdquo; not from this Stockbridge road, but from the first
milestone on the road to Romsey, whence the city may be seen
&ldquo;as in an isometric drawing&rdquo; set down in its vale of
Itchen, &ldquo;the broad cathedral tower with its Norman windows
and immense length of aisle and nave, the spires of St.
Thomas&rsquo;s, the pinnacled tower of the college, and, more to
the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice, where to
this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale.&nbsp;
Behind the city swept the rotund upland of St. Catherine&rsquo;s
Hill; further off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon
was lost in the radiance of the sun hanging above it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning away from the contemplation of these things, and
overpassing the crest of Roebuck Hill <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and its sponsorial inn, the road dips
down suddenly into the tiny village of Weeke, whose name is
sometimes, with romantic medi&aelig;valism, spelled
&ldquo;Wyke.&rdquo;&nbsp; For myself, did I reside there, I would
certainly have my notepaper stamped &ldquo;Wyke next
Winchester,&rdquo; and find much satisfaction therein.&nbsp; Wyke
consists, when fully summed up, of a characteristic rural
Hampshire church, with little wooden belfry and walls of flint
and red brick, of some scattered farms and of a roadside pond, a
great prim red-bricked house of Georgian date, and a row of
pollard limes on a grassy bank overlooking the road.</p>
<p>And then?&nbsp; Then the road goes on, past more uplands,
divided into fields whose smooth convexity gives the appearance
of even greater size than they possess: every circumstance of
their featureless rotundity disclosed from the highway across the
sparse hedges, reduced by free use of the billhook to the
smallest semblance of a hedge, consistent with the preservation
of a boundary.&nbsp; Wayside trees are to seek, and the wayfarer
pants in summer for lack of shade, and in winter is chilled to
the bone, as the winds roam free across Worthy downs.</p>
<p>Such is the way up Harestock Hill; not so grim as perhaps this
description may convey, but really very beautiful in its sort,
with a few cottages topping the rise where a signpost points a
road to Littleton and Crawley, and where the white-topped
equatorial of an observatory serves to emphasise a wholly
unobstructed view over miles of sky.&nbsp; It is only from vast
skyfields such as this that one hears the song of the skylark on
those still summer days when the sky is of the intensest azure
blue and the bees are busy wherever <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the farmer has left nooks for the
wild-flowers to grow.&nbsp; On such days the dark woods of
Lainston, crowning the distant ridge, lend a welcome shade.&nbsp;
Fortunately they are easy of access, for the road runs by them
and an inconspicuous stile leads directly into one of the
rook-haunted alleys of those romantic avenues with which the
place is criss-crossed.&nbsp; A slightly marked footpath through
undergrowth thickly spread with the desiccated leaves of autumns
past, where the hedgehog hides and squirrels and wild life of
every kind abound, leads by a crackling track of dried twigs and
the empty husks of last year&rsquo;s beech-nuts to another stile
and across a byroad into another of the five grand avenues
leading to Lainston House, a romantically gloomy, but
architecturally very fine, late seventeenth-century mansion
embowered amid foliage, with a ruined manorial chapel close at
hand in a darkling corner amid the close-set mossy boles of the
trees.&nbsp; The spot would form an ideal setting for one of the
Wessex tales, and indeed has a part in a sufficiently queer story
in actual life.&nbsp; That tale is now historic&mdash;how
Walpole&rsquo;s &ldquo;&AElig;lia L&aelig;lia Chudleigh&rdquo;
was in 1745 privately married, in this now roofless chapel, to
Captain Hervey, a naval officer who afterwards succeeded to the
title of third Earl of Bristol.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss
Chudleigh,&rdquo; however, she still continued to be at
Court.&nbsp; Twenty-five years later she was the heroine of a
bigamy case, having married, while her first husband was living,
Pierrepont, Duke of Kingston.&nbsp; This was that lively lady
who, Walpole tells us, &ldquo;went to Ranelagh as Iphigenia, but
as naked as Andromeda.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
ruined chapel has long been in that condition.&nbsp; Its font
lies, broken and green with damp, on the grass, and the old
ledger-stones that cover the remains of Chudleighs and Dawleys,
successive owners of the manor, are cracked and defaced.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;living&rdquo; of Lainston is worth &pound;60 per
annum, and goes with that of the neighbouring village of
Sparsholt, the vicar holding it by virtue of preaching here once
a year.&nbsp; Stress of weather occasionally obliges him to
perform this duty under the shelter of an umbrella, when his
congregation, like that of the saint who preached to the birds,
is composed chiefly of rooks and jackdaws.&nbsp; But their
responses are not always well timed, and the notes of the jackdaw
sound uncommonly like the scoffings of the ribald.</p>
<p>One emerges from Lainston woods only to perceive this to be a
district of many woodlands.&nbsp; Across the road is Northwood,
where, close by Eastman&rsquo;s great school, are thick coppices
of hazels and undergrowths that the primroses and bluebells
love.&nbsp; In another direction lies Sparsholt.&nbsp; None may
tell what the &ldquo;Spar&rdquo; in the place-name of this or the
other Sparsholt in Berkshire means, but &ldquo;holt&rdquo;
signifies a wood; and thus we may perceive that the surroundings
must still wear very much the aspect they owned when the name was
conferred.&nbsp; Sparsholt has no guidebook
attractions&mdash;nothing but its old thatched cottages and quiet
surroundings to recommend it.&nbsp; But the fragrant scent of the
wood-smoke from cottage hearths is over all.&nbsp; You may see
its blue filmy wreaths curling upwards on still days, against the
dark background of foliage.&nbsp; It is a rustic fragrance never
forgotten, an aroma which, <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>go whithersoever you will, brings
back the sweet memory of days that were, and the sound of a voice
in more actual fashion than possible to the notes of a
well-remembered song, or the scent of a rose.</p>
<p>They are not woods of forest trees that beset this district,
but hillside tangles of scrub oaks, of hazels and alders, where
the wild-flowers make a continual glory in early spring.&nbsp;
There are the labyrinths of No Man&rsquo;s Land, the intricacies
of Privet and Crab Wood, through whose bosquets run the
long-deserted Roman road from Winchester to Old Sarum, and the
nameless spinneys dotted everywhere about.&nbsp; Away on the
horizon you may perceive a monument, capping a hill.&nbsp; It is
no memorial of gallantries in war, but is the obelisk erected on
Farley Mount to the horse of a certain &ldquo;Paulet St.
John,&rdquo; which jumped with him into a chalk-pit twenty-five
feet deep, emerging, with his rider, unhurt.&nbsp; That was in
1733.&nbsp; An inscription tells how that wonderful animal was
afterwards entered for the Hunters&rsquo; Plate, under the name
of &ldquo;Beware Chalk Pit,&rdquo; at the races on Worthy downs,
and won it.</p>
<p>Continuing on to Stockbridge, whose race-meeting has recently
been abolished, the way grows grim indeed, with that Roman
grimness characteristic of all the Wessex chalky down
country.&nbsp; The road is long, and at times, when the sun is
setting and the landscape fades away in purple twilight, the
explorer becomes obsessed, against all reason, with the weird
notion that the many centuries of civilisation are but a dream
and the distant ages come back again.&nbsp; To this bareness the
pleasant little town of Stockbridge, situated delightfully in the
valley of the <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Anton, is a gracious interlude.&nbsp; In its old
churchyard the curious may still see the whimsical epitaph to
John Bucket, landlord of the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; inn,
who died, aged 67, in 1802:</p>
<blockquote><p>And is, alas! poor Bucket gone?<br />
Farewell, convivial honest John.<br />
Oft at the well, by fatal stroke<br />
Buckets like pitchers must be broke.<br />
In this same motley shifting scene,<br />
How various have thy fortunes been.<br />
Now lifting high, now sinking low,<br />
To-day the brim would overflow.<br />
Thy bounty then would all supply<br />
To fill, and drink, and leave thee dry.<br />
To-morrow sunk as in a well,<br />
Content unseen with Truth to dwell.<br />
But high or low, or wet or dry,<br />
No rotten stave could malice spy.<br />
Then rise, immortal Bucket, rise<br />
And claim thy station in the skies;<br />
Twixt Amphora and Pisces shine,<br />
Still guarding Stockbridge with thy sign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1715, when the poet Gay rode horseback to Exeter and wrote
a rhymed account of his journey for the Earl of Burlington, he
described Stockbridge in doleful dumps.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because
for seven years there had been no election:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sad melancholy ev&rsquo;ry visage wears;<br />
What! no election come in seven long years!<br />
Of all our race of Mayors, shall Snow alone<br />
Be by Sir Richard&rsquo;s dedication known?<br />
Our streets no more with tides of ale shall float!<br />
Nor cobblers feast three years upon one vote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of this seems cryptic, but it is explained by the fact of
Sir Richard Steele having published, September 22nd, 1713, a
quarto pamphlet <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>entitled <i>The Importance of Dunkirk considered</i> . .
. <i>in a letter to the Bailiff of Stockbridge</i>, whose name
was John Snow.&nbsp; The number of voters at Stockbridge was then
about seventy, and its population chiefly cobblers.&nbsp; To say
it was a corrupt borough is merely to state what might be said of
almost every one at that time; but it seems to have been
especially notable, even above its corrupt fellows, for a
contemporary chronicler is found writing: &ldquo;It is a very wet
town and the voters are wet too.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then continues,
as one deploring the depreciation of securities, &ldquo;The
ordinary price of a vote is &pound;60, but better times may
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when elections only came septennially, the
wet voters who subsisted three years upon one vote must have gone
dry, poor fellows, an unconscionable while.</p>
<p>Some ten miles north of Stockbridge, on the road past Andover,
and overlooking the valley of the Anton, is Weyhill, a Hardy
landmark of especial importance, for it is the point whence
starts that fine tale, <i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i>,
described in its sub-title as &ldquo;The Life and Death of a Man
of Character.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a pleasant country of soft
riverain features by which you who seek to make pilgrimage to
this spot shall fare, coming into the quiet, cheerful little
market-town of Andover, and thenceforward near by the villages
which owe their curiously feminine names to their baptismal
river, the Anton.&nbsp; There you shall find Abbot&rsquo;s Ann
and Little Ann, and I daresay, if you seek long enough, Mary Ann
also.&nbsp; Weyhill, a hamlet in the parish of Penton Mewsey, is
a place&mdash;although to look at it, you might not <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>suspect
so&mdash;of hoary antiquity, and its Fair&mdash;still famous, and
still the largest in England&mdash;old enough to be the subject
of comment in <i>Piers Plowman&rsquo;s Vision</i>, in the
line:</p>
<blockquote><p>At Wy and at Wynchestre I went to ye fair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas that such things should be! this old-time six-days&rsquo;
annual market is now reduced to four.&nbsp; It is held between
October 10th and 13th, and divided into the Sheep, Horse, Hops,
Cheese, Statute or Hiring, and Pleasure Fairs.&nbsp; On each of
these days the three miles&rsquo; stretch of road from Andover is
thronged with innumerable wayfarers and made unutterably dusty by
the cabs and flys and the dense flocks of sheep and cattle on
their way to the Fair ground.</p>
<p>There are quaint survivals at Weyhill Fair.&nbsp; An
umbrella-seller may still, with every recurrent year, be seen
selling the most bulgeous and antique umbrellas, some of them
almost archaic enough to belong to the days of Jonas Hanway, who
introduced the use of such things in the eighteenth century; and
unheard-of village industries display their produce to the
astonished gaze.&nbsp; Here, for example, you see an exhibit of
modern malt-shovels, together with the maker of them, the
&ldquo;W. Choules from Penton&rdquo; whose name is painted up
over his unassuming corner; and although the Londoner has
probably never heard of, and certainly never seen, malt-shovels,
the making of them is obviously still a living industry.</p>
<p>Greatly to the stranger&rsquo;s surprise, Weyhill, although in
fact situated above the valley of the Anton, does not appear to
be situated on a hill at <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>all.&nbsp; The road to &ldquo;Weydon
Priors,&rdquo; by which name it figures in <i>The Mayor of
Casterbridge</i>, is indeed, as the novelist sufficiently hints,
of no very marked features.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;a road neither
straight nor crooked, neither level nor hilly,&rdquo; and at
times other than Fair-time is as quiet a country road&mdash;for a
high road&mdash;as you shall meet; and, except for that one week
in the year, Weyhill is as a derelict village.&nbsp; There, on a
grassy tableland, stand, deserted for fifty-one weeks out of
every fifty-two, the whitewashed booths and rows of sheds that
annually for a brief space do so strenuous a trade, and scarce a
human being comes into view.&nbsp; Even now, just as in the
beginning of the story, Weyhill does not grow: &ldquo;Pulling
down is more the nater of Weydon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is on the last day of the old six-days&rsquo; Fair, in
1829, that the story opens, with a man and woman&mdash;the woman
carrying a child&mdash;walking along this dusty road.&nbsp; That
they were man and wife was, according to the novelist&rsquo;s
sardonic humour, plain to see, for they carried along with them a
&ldquo;stale familiarity, like a nimbus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man was
the hay-trusser, Michael Henchard, whose after rise to be Mayor
of Casterbridge and whose final fall are chronicled in the
story.&nbsp; This opening scene is merely in the nature of a
prologue, disclosing the itinerant hay-trusser seeking work,
coming to the Fair and there selling his wife for five guineas to
the only bidder, a sailor&mdash;the second chapter resuming the
march of events eighteen years later.</p>
<h2><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">STOCKBRIDGE TO
SALISBURY AND STONEHENGE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Returning</span> to Stockbridge, <i>en
route</i> for Salisbury, eight miles more of roads of the same
unchanging characteristics, but growing more plentifully carpeted
with crushed flints as we advance, bring us to Wiltshire and to a
junction with the Exeter Road from Andover at Lobcombe
Corner.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood are &ldquo;the Wallops,&rdquo;
as local parlance refers to a group of three villages, Over and
Nether Wallop, with the wayside settlement of Little (or Middle)
Wallop in between.&nbsp; It is this last-named to which Mr. Hardy
refers when he tells how the ruined and broken-hearted Mayor of
Casterbridge, fleeing from the scene of his vanished greatness
and resuming his early occupation of hay-trusser, became employed
at a &ldquo;pastoral farm near the old western highway. . .
.&nbsp; He had chosen the neighbourhood of this artery from a
sense that, situated here, though at a distance of fifty miles,
he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare was so dear than he
would be at a roadless spot only half as remote.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dorchester, otherwise Casterbridge, is in fact just forty-nine
and a half miles distant, down this old Exeter Road.</p>
<p>In less than another mile on our westward way <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the sight of
a solitary house in all this apparently uninhabited wilderness
arouses speculations in the pilgrim&rsquo;s
mind&mdash;speculations resolved on approach, when the sight of
the recently restored picture-sign of the &ldquo;Pheasant,&rdquo;
reared up on its posts on the short grass of the open down,
opposite its door, proclaims this to be the old coaching inn once
famed as &ldquo;Winterslow Hut.&rdquo;&nbsp; None ever spoke of
the inn in those days as the &ldquo;Pheasant,&rdquo; although
that was the sign of it, plainly to be seen; as &ldquo;Winterslow
Hut&rdquo; it was always known, and a more lonely, forbidding
place of seclusion from the haunts of man it would be difficult
to find.&nbsp; It was once, appropriately enough, the retreat of
a lonely, forbidding person&mdash;the self-selected place of
exile from society of Hazlitt, the essayist, who, parting from
his wife at the village of West Winterslow (whence the inn takes
its name of &ldquo;Winterslow Hut&rdquo;) two miles away, lived
here from 1819 to 1828.&nbsp; Here he wrote the essays on
&ldquo;Persons one would wish to have seen,&rdquo; and the much
less sociable essay, &ldquo;On Living to One&rsquo;s
Self&rdquo;&mdash;an art he practised here to his own
satisfaction and the cheerful resignation of the many persons
with whom he quarrelled.&nbsp; And here he saw the Exeter Mail
and the stage-coaches go by, and must have found the place even
lonelier, in the intervals after their passing, than it seems now
that the Road, as an institution, is dead and the Rail conveys
the traffic to and from Salisbury and the west, some two miles
distant, across country hidden from view from this point beneath
the swelling shoulders of the unchanging downs.</p>
<p>Salisbury spire is soon seen, when the long drop <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>into the
valley of the Wiltshire Avon, down Three Mile Hill, begins; its
slender spire, the tallest in England, thrusting its long
needle-point 404 feet into the blue, and oddly peering out from
the swooping sides of the downs, long before any suspicion of
Sarum itself&mdash;as the milestones style it&mdash;has occupied
the mind of the literary pilgrim.</p>
<p>Salisbury, like some bland and contented elderly spinster,
does not look its age.&nbsp; When you are told how Old Sarum was
abandoned, New Sarum founded, and everything recreated <i>ad
hoc</i> at the command of Bishop Poore, impelled thereto by a
vision, in the then customary way, you are so impressed with what
we are used to regard as such thoroughly &ldquo;American&rdquo;
proceedings that you forget, in the apparent modernity of such a
method, how very long ago all this was done.&nbsp; This great
change of site took place about 1220, and sixty years later the
great cathedral, remarkable and indeed unique among all our
cathedrals for being designed and built, from the laying of the
foundation stone to the roofing-in of the building, in
one&mdash;the Early English&mdash;style, was completed.&nbsp; It
was actually a century later that the spire itself was
finished.</p>
<p>Much of this seeming youthfulness of Salisbury is due to the
regularity of plan upon which the city is laid out, and to the
comparative breadth of its streets.&nbsp; To that phenomenally
simple-minded person, Tom Pinch, whose like certainly could never
have been met with outside the pages of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>,
Salisbury seemed &ldquo;a very desperate sort of place; an
exceedingly wild and dissipated city.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we smile
superior, although it is true <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>that in his short story, <i>On the
Western Circuit</i>, Mr. Hardy presents Melchester, as he names
this fair city, as given over to blazing orgies in the progress
of Melchester Fair, with steam-trumpeting merry-go-rounds,
glamour and glitter, glancing young women no better than they
ought to be, and an amorous young barrister much worse than he
should have been.&nbsp; Granting the truth of this picture of
Melchester Fair, it is to be observed that this is but an
interlude in a twelvemonth&rsquo;s programme of polished,
decorous, and well-ordered urbanity.&nbsp; Its character is more
truly portrayed in <i>Jude the Obscure</i>, where Sue Bridehead
having gone to the city, to enter the Training College in the
Close, her cousin Jude follows her.&nbsp; He found it &ldquo;a
quiet and soothing place, almost entirely ecclesiastical in its
tone; a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness
had no establishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was here he obtained work
at his trade of stonemason, labouring on the restoration of the
cathedral; here that Sue shocked his ecclesiastical and
medi&aelig;val bent, meeting his suggestion that they should sit
for a talk in the cathedral by the proposal that she would rather
wait in the railway station: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the centre of
town life now&mdash;the cathedral has had its day!&rdquo;&nbsp;
To his shocked interjection, &ldquo;How modern you are!&rdquo;
she replied defensively, &ldquo;I am not modern, either.&nbsp; I
am more ancient than medi&aelig;valism, if you only knew&rdquo;;
meaning thereby that she was enamoured of classicism and the old
pagans.</p>
<p>To Sue the cathedral was not unsympathetic merely by force of
that clear-cut regularity which impresses most beholders with a
sense of a splendid, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>but cold, perfection.&nbsp; There are
those who compare this great fane with Tennyson&rsquo;s Lady
Clara Vere de Vere:</p>
<blockquote><p>Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly
null,<br />
Dead perfection, no more;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but while those critics are critics only of design and carved
stones, who would welcome something in its regular features
paralleled by a tip-tilted nose in a human face, Sue was
obviously preoccupied by the sense that it, not alone among
cathedrals, has outlived the devotional needs that produced it,
and is little more than a magnificent museum of architectural
antiquities.&nbsp; That magnificence would be even more complete
and pronounced had not the egregious James Wyatt been let loose
upon the &ldquo;restoration&rdquo; of it, towards the close of
the eighteenth century, when he cast out and destroyed most of
its internal adornments, and pulled down and utterly obliterated
the beautiful detached bell tower, coeval with the cathedral
itself, which stood, away from it, on the north side.</p>
<p>It is perhaps worthy of remark that there may be noticed in
the cathedral the tomb, with somewhat bombastic inscription, of
Dr. D&rsquo;Albigny Turberville, the seventeenth-century oculist,
who died, aged 85, in 1696.&nbsp; The flagrant Latin, which tells
us that his fame shall perish no sooner than this marble, does
not allow for human forgetfulness, nor for the advances of
science.</p>
<p>The Normal School in the Close, whence Sue escaped, after
being confined to her room as a punishment for her night&rsquo;s
escapade with Jude, is a prominent building, described as
&ldquo;an ancient <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>edifice of the fifteenth century, once a palace . . .
with mullioned and transomed windows, and a courtyard in front
shut in from the road by a wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>From the ever-impending tragedy of Jude&rsquo;s ambitions it
is a relief to turn to the pure comedy of Betty Dornell, the
first Countess of Wessex, in that collection of diverting short
stories, <i>A Group of Noble Dames</i>.&nbsp; Looking upon those
two old inns, the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; in the High Street and
the &ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; we are reminded that it was to the
first-named that Betty resorted with that husband with whom,
although married at an early age, she had not lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twice we met by accident,&rsquo; pleaded Betty
to her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Once at Abbot&rsquo;s Cernel and
another time at the &ldquo;Red Lion,&rdquo;
Melchester.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O, thou deceitful girl!&rsquo; cried Mrs.
Dornell.&nbsp; &lsquo;An accident took you to the &ldquo;Red
Lion&rdquo; whilst I was staying at the &ldquo;White
Hart&rdquo;!&nbsp; I remember&mdash;you came in at twelve
o&rsquo;clock at night and said you&rsquo;d been to see the
cathedral by the light o&rsquo; the moon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My ever-honoured mamma, so I had!&nbsp; I only
went to the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; with him
afterwards.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine miles to the north of Melchester stands Stonehenge,
reached after their flight through the deserted midnight streets
of the city by Tess and Angel Clare, vainly endeavouring to elude
justice after the murder of the sham D&rsquo;Urberville at
Sandbourne.&nbsp; The night was &ldquo;as dark as a cave,&rdquo;
and a stiff breeze blew as they came out upon the black solitudes
of Salisbury Plain.&nbsp; For some miles they had proceeded thus,
when &ldquo;on a sudden <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Clare became conscious of some vast
erection close in his front, rising sheer from the grass.&nbsp;
They had almost struck themselves against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What monstrous place is this?&rsquo; said
Angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It hums,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hearken!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming
tune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed
harp.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was indeed Stonehenge, &ldquo;a very Temple
of the Winds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here, as the night wore away, and Tess lay sleeping on the
Altar Stone, and the great trilithons began to show up blackly
against the coming dawn, the figure of a man advancing towards
them appeared rising out of the hollows of the great plain.&nbsp;
At the same time Clare heard the brush of feet behind him: they
were surrounded.&nbsp; Thoughts of resistance came to him; but
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use, sir,&rsquo; said the foremost
plain-clothes man: &lsquo;There are sixteen of us on the Plain,
and the whole country is reared.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And so they
stood watching while Tess finished her sleep.</p>
<p>Stonehenge sadly requires such romantic passages as this to
renew its interest, for, truth to tell, the first glimpse of this
mysterious monument of prehistoric ages is wofully
disappointing.&nbsp; No use to strive against that disappointment
as you come up the long rises from Amesbury under the midday sun
and see its every time-worn cranny displayed mercilessly in the
impudent eye of day: the interval between anticipation and
realisation is too wide, and the apparent smallness and
insignificance of the great stone circles must, although
unwillingly, be allowed.&nbsp; This comparative insignificance
is, however, largely the effect of their almost boundless <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>environment
of vast downs, tumid with the attendant circles of prehistoric
tumuli, each tumulus or barrow crowned with its clump of trees,
like the tufted plumes of a hearse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image32" href="images/p32.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Mystery continues to shroud the origin of Stonehenge, which
was probably standing when the Romans first overran Britain, and
seems by the most reasoned theories to have really been a Temple
of the Sun.&nbsp; Its name is only the comparatively modern one
of &ldquo;Stanenges,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the hanging stones,&rdquo;
given by the Saxons, who discovered it with as much astonishment
as exhibited by any one of a later age, and so named it, not from
any reference to the capital punishment of <i>sus. per coll.</i>,
but from the great lintel-stones that are laid flat upon the tall
rude columns, and may fancifully be said to hang in mid-air, at a
height of twenty-five feet.</p>
<p>Those who speak of Stonehenge remaining a &ldquo;monument to
all time,&rdquo; speak not according to knowledge, for the poor
old relic is becoming sadly weatherworn and decrepit, and has
aged rapidly of late years.&nbsp; No good has been wrought it by
the fussy interferences and impertinences of
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; men, who, taking advantage of an alleged
necessity for shoring up one the largest stones, dug about the
soil and strove to wrest its secret by the method of sifting the
spadesful of earth and stone chippings.&nbsp; Then a last
indignity befell it.&nbsp; Sir Edward Antrobus, of Amesbury, lord
of the manor, claimed Stonehenge as his manorial property, and,
erecting a barbed-wire fence around it, levied a fee of a
shilling a head for admission through the turnstiles that click
you through, for all the world as though <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>you were
entering some Earl&rsquo;s Court Exhibition.&nbsp; The impudence
that has found it possible to do these things, in defiance of
undoubted public rights of way, bulks majestically&mdash;much
larger than Stonehenge itself, whose grey pile it indeed
belittles and vulgarises.</p>

35</span>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">THE OLD COACH-ROAD:
SALISBURY TO BLANDFORD</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is thirty-eight and a half miles
from Salisbury to Dorchester, the &ldquo;Casterbridge&rdquo; of
the novels, along the old coach-road to Exeter.&nbsp; Speaking as
an exploratory cyclist, I would ten times rather go the reverse
way, from west to east, for the gradients are all against the
westward traveller, and westerly winds are the prevailing airs
during summer and autumn.&nbsp; It is, indeed, a terribly
difficult road, exposed, and very trying in its long rises.&nbsp;
One charming interlude there is, three miles from Salisbury, at
the beautifully situated little village of Coombe Bissett, set
down in the deep valley of an affluent of the Wiltshire Avon; but
it is heartbreaking work climbing out of it again, up the
inclines of Crowden Down.&nbsp; At eight miles&rsquo; distance
from Salisbury the old Woodyates Inn, long since re-christened
the &ldquo;Shaftesbury Arms,&rdquo; stands in a lonely situation
beside the road, looking regretful for bygone coaching
days.&nbsp; Its old name, deriving from &ldquo;wood-gates,&rdquo;
indicated its position on the south-western marches of the wooded
district of Cranborne Chase.&nbsp; When railways disestablished
coaches and the road resumed its solitude, the old inn became for
a time the home of William Day&rsquo;s <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>training establishment for
racehorses.&nbsp; He tells, in his recollections, of the drinking
habits of the old Wiltshire farmers in general, and of two in
particular, who used to call at Woodyates when on their way to or
from Salisbury.&nbsp; They would talk, over the fire and their
glasses of grog, somewhat in this fashion of their drunken
exploits when riding home horseback: &ldquo;Well, John, I fell
off ten times.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, Thomas, and I fell off a
dozen times: you see, I rode the old black horse, and he always
jerks me about so.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was said that there was
scarcely a yard of ground over the eight miles that these
worthies had not fallen on to from their horses.</p>

<a name="image36" href="images/p36.jpg">
<img alt=
"Pentridge"

</a></p>
<p>At the distance of a mile from the coach-road at this point,
where, by the way, we leave Wilts and enter Dorset, is the Hardy
landmark of &ldquo;Trantridge,&rdquo; to be identified with the
little village of Pentridge set down on the map.&nbsp; It was to
Trantridge that Tess came early in her career, from her home at
Marnhull in the Vale of Blackmore, to take service with Mrs.
Stoke-D&rsquo;Urberville of The <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Slopes, relict of Mr. Simon Stoke,
merchant or money-lender, who had unwarrantably assumed the name,
the crest, and arms of the knightly
D&rsquo;Urbervilles&mdash;dead and gone and powerless to resent
the affront.&nbsp; It would be useless to seek The Slopes, rising
in all the glory of its new crimson brick &ldquo;like a geranium
bloom against the subdued colours around&rdquo;; but plain to
see, not far away, is the &ldquo;soft azure landscape of the
Chase&mdash;a truly venerable tract of forest land, one of the
few remaining woodlands in England, of undoubted prim&aelig;val
date.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in the Chase that the ruin of Tess was
wrought by Alec D&rsquo;Urberville.</p>
<p>The exceedingly rustic village of Pentridge nestles under the
lee of a long, partly wooded hill, probably the
&ldquo;ridge&rdquo; referred to in the place-name.&nbsp; In the
little highly restored or rebuilt church with the stone spirelet
is now to be seen, since August, 1902, when it was erected, the
plain white marble tablet:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
the Memory of</span><br />
ROBERT BROWNING,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">of Woodyates, in this parish, who
died Nov. 25th, 1746,<br />
and is the first known forefather of<br />
Robert Browning, the poet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">He was formerly footman and butler
in the<br />
Bankes family.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;All service ranks the same
with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Browning</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>This Tablet</i><br />
was erected by some of the poet&rsquo;s friends and admirers<br
/>
1902.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much reflected glory doubtless accrues to &ldquo;the Bankes
family&rdquo; from this tablet, which owes its being <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to the
exertions of Dr. F. J. Furnivall.&nbsp; It seems that the
poet&rsquo;s ancestor, after severing his connection with the
Bankes, became landlord of the Woodyates Inn, and churchwarden
here.</p>
<p>This entrance to Dorsetshire is not so favourable an one as
that, for example, from Somerset, by Templecombe and Stalbridge
or Sherborne, where Dorset is indeed like unto the Land of
Promise, a land flowing with milk and honey, where herds of
cattle low musically in mead or byre, and the earth is
alluvial&mdash;rich, deep, and sticky.</p>
<p>Here is the more arid, elevated country of open down; chalky,
and producing only coarse grass, pine-trees, bracken, and
furze&mdash;a sheep-grazing, as opposed to a cattle-rearing,
district.&nbsp; Dorset is indeed a greatly varied county in the
character of its soils.&nbsp; The sheep-grazing districts may be
said to be this of the north-east border, and those other
stretches of lofty, almost waterless chalk downs, running due
east and west, parallel with the coast, with a similarly lengthy,
but broader, stretch in a like direction, from where the downs
rise from the Stour at Sturminster Marshall, past Milton Abbas
and Cerne Abbas, on to Beaminster.&nbsp; In between these are the
valleys of the River Frome&mdash;the &ldquo;Vale of Great
Dairies&rdquo; of <i>Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>, and the
&ldquo;Vale of Little Dairies&rdquo; in the same story, otherwise
Blackmore Vale.&nbsp; A glance at the map will show the River
Frome flowing in its &ldquo;green trough of sappiness and
humidity&rdquo; from the neighbourhood of Beaminster, past
Chilfroom, Frome Vanchurch, and Frampton, which most obviously
take their name from the stream, to Dorchester, Moreton, Wool,
and <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Wareham, whence it pours its enriching waters into Poole
Harbour; and another glance will discover the Vale of Little
Dairies, or Blackmore, bounded by Blandford and Minterne Magna,
and the heights of High Stoy on the south, and by Shaftesbury,
Wincanton, and Sherborne on the north; including within its
compass Stalbridge and Sturminster Newton, together with a host
of small villages.&nbsp; The natural outlet of this last
district&mdash;which, despite the name of &ldquo;Little
Dairies,&rdquo; given to it in the pages of the novels, is a
larger area than that of the Frome valley, and of course produces
in the aggregation more&mdash;is the railway junction of
Templecombe, which, beyond being a mere junction, is also an
exceedingly busy and bustling place for the receipt of all this
dairy produce of Blackmore.</p>
<p>Such are, roughly, the main agricultural divisions of Dorset,
which is, to the hard-working farmer who is his own bailiff, with
his family to aid in the dairy-work, still a county where ends
may be made to meet, with a considerable selvedge or overlapping
to sweeten his industry.&nbsp; Despite a very general belief
current in towns, there are still considerable numbers of these
families.&nbsp; The farmer and his wife have largely grown out of
the rustic speech, and their sons and daughters&mdash;the
daughters especially, the adaptive dears!&mdash;have got culture
for leisure moments, but they are none the less practical for
that.&nbsp; A generation ago, perhaps, things were not so
pleasing, for the then would-be up-to-date attempted the
absurdity of aping the leisured classes, while seeking to carry
on farming and obtain a living by it.&nbsp; Such as those came to
grief, and <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>were rightly the butts of outside observers, as well as
of moralists of their own class.&nbsp; A thorough-going farmer of
that period, who saw the daughters of his neighbour going on the
way to their music-lesson, reported his feelings and sayings as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I and an&rsquo; my wife were out a-milken, they
maidens went by, an&rsquo; I zaid to her, &lsquo;Where be they
maidens a-gwoin&rsquo;?&rsquo; an&rsquo; she zaid, &lsquo;Oh!
they be a-gwoin&rsquo; to their music.&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; I
zaid, &lsquo;Oh! a-gwoin&rsquo; to their music at
milken-time!&nbsp; That &rsquo;ull come to zom&rsquo;ehat, that
wull.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And it doubtless did come to a pretty
considerable deal, if&mdash;as a doctor might say&mdash;the
course of the disease was normal.</p>
<p>Resuming the main road, which for the distance of a mile
beyond Woodyates is identical with the old Roman road, the Via
Iceniana, that ancient relic of a past civilisation may presently
be seen parting company from the modern highway, and going off by
itself, to the left, across the downs, making for the great
fortified hill of Badbury Rings.&nbsp; It is known locally as the
Achling Dyke, and is somewhat conspicuously elevated above the
bracken, the gorse, and heather of these wilds.</p>
<p>Now, passing a few scattered cottages, we come&mdash;in
fifteen miles from Coombe Bissett&mdash;to a village, the first
on this lonely main road.&nbsp; Tarrant Hinton, this welcome
village, stands on a sparkling little stream, without doubt the
&ldquo;tarrant,&rdquo; or torrent, whence it and a small
sisterhood of neighbouring settlements obtain a generic
name.&nbsp; There are Tarrant Gunville, Tarrant Monkton, Tarrant
Rawston, Tarrant Rushton, Tarrant Keynston, and Tarrant Crawford;
and then, as below the last-named place <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>the little
stream falls into the Stour, there are no more Tarrants.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image41" href="images/p41.jpg">
<img alt=
"Eastbury"
title=
"Eastbury"
 src="images/p41.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>To Tarrant Gunville belongs Eastbury Park, a place of
Hardyesque and romantic aspect; but, so far, not made the vehicle
of any of his stories.&nbsp; It has, to be sure, a story of its
own&mdash;a tale of vaulting ambition which fell on t&rsquo;other
side.&nbsp; Eastbury was built, like many another ponderous and
overgrown mansion of the eighteenth century, by Vanbrugh, to the
commission of George Dodington, a former Lord of the Admiralty,
who, growing enormously rich by long-continued peculation,
blossomed out as a patron of the arts and a friend of
literature.&nbsp; But before his huge house could be completed he
was gathered to his fathers and to judgment upon his illegitimate
pickings, leaving all his wealth to his grandnephew, George Bubb
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Dodington,
afterwards Lord Melcombe, who lavished &pound;140,000 on the
completion of the works.&nbsp; Here he too became a patron, and
entertained the literary men of his time until 1762, when, dying,
the property went to Earl Temple, who, unable to afford the
expense of maintaining the immense place, actually
offered&mdash;and offered in vain&mdash;an income of &pound;200 a
year to any one who would reside at Eastbury and keep it in
repair.&nbsp; As this bait failed, the great house was dismantled
and demolished, piecemeal, in 1795, only one wing remaining to
attest its former grandeur.</p>
<p>But traces of that grandeur are not wanting, from the iron
railings, stone piers, and decorative kerbs, carved boldly with
an acanthus-leaved design, that conduct into the demesne, to the
magnificent clumps of beeches and other forest trees studding the
sward of what was the park; and that remaining wing itself, still
disclosing in its arcade, or loggia, something of
Vanbrugh&rsquo;s design.</p>
<p>Eastbury, of course, is haunted&mdash;so much is to be
expected of such a place; but those who have seen the headless
coachman and his ghostly four-in-hand issuing from the park
gates, or returning, are growing scarce, and times are become so
sceptical that even they cannot obtain credence.&nbsp; So, with a
sigh for the decay of belief, we will e&rsquo;en on through
Pimperne down to Blandford, which good town, of fine dignified
classic architectural presence, the coach-road enters in a timid
back-doors manner, down a narrow byway.</p>
<p>Blandford is further dignified by that curious pedantic
Latinity very marked in many Dorsetshire place-names.&nbsp; In
this manner it is made to figure <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>as &ldquo;Blandford Forum,&rdquo; a
rendering of &ldquo;Blandford Market.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Mr. Thomas
Hardy&rsquo;s pages it is &ldquo;Shottsford Forum,&rdquo; and so
appears in his story of <i>Barbara of the House of Grebe</i>, in
<i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>, and again in <i>The
Woodlanders</i>, wherein it is stated, from the mouth of a rustic
character, that &ldquo;Shottsford is Shottsford still: you
can&rsquo;t victual your carcass there unless you&rsquo;ve got
money, and you can&rsquo;t buy a cup of genuine there, whether or
no&rdquo;; this last a sad drawback from the amenities of a
delightful town.&nbsp; But there is a very excellent pump, and an
historic, in the broad High Street, whereon, cast in enduring
iron, it may be read how a certain John Bastard, a
&ldquo;considerable sharer&rdquo; in the great calamity by which
Blandford was burnt in 1731, &ldquo;humbly erected this monument,
in grateful Acknowledgement of the Divine Mercy, That has since
raised this Town, Like the Phoenix from its Ashes, to its present
flourishing and beautiful State.&rdquo;&nbsp; That, it will be
allowed, is rather a fine, curly, and romantic way of putting
it.&nbsp; A rider to this inscription goes on to say that in 1899
the Corporation of Blandford converted the pump into a
drinking-fountain, and that the Blandford Waterworks Company, not
halting in good deeds, gratuitously supplies the water.</p>
<p>The pilgrim who, arriving in Blandford hot, dusty and thirsty,
and perhaps mindful of that alleged impossibility of buying a cup
of genuine, essays to drink from the fountain, is at first
surprised at the keen interest taken in his proceedings by a
quickly collecting group of urchins.&nbsp; Their curiosity
appears to be in the nature of surprise at the sight of a grown
man drinking water, but light is shed upon <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>it when,
pressing hard the obstinate knob that releases the fount, the
thing suddenly gives way and squirts half a pint or so up his
sleeve.&nbsp; This is a never-failing form of entertainment to
the youth of Blandford, and a cheap one.</p>
<p>Not once, but several times has Blandford been destroyed by
fire.&nbsp; It owed these disasters to the old Dorsetshire
fashion of thatched roofs, and only in time, by dint of repeated
happenings in this sort, learned wisdom.&nbsp; This light dawned
at the time when the classic revival in architecture was
flourishing, and thus, as already hinted, Blandford&rsquo;s High
Street is wholly of that character.&nbsp; Classicism does not
often make for beauty in English towns, but here the general
effect is admirable, and although the stone of the fine
church-tower&mdash;designed in the same taste&mdash;is of a
jaundiced greenish-yellow hue, it is a noble feature.</p>
<p>Blandford&rsquo;s natives have sometimes won to a great deal
more than local fame; witness Alfred Stevens, the designer of the
Wellington monument in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, who was born
in 1817, in Salisbury Street, that back-doors coach-road entrance
into the town already mentioned.&nbsp; Willowes, the unhappy
husband of Barbara, of the House of Grebe, was a descendant of
one of the old families of glass-painters of Shottsford mentioned
in that story, and more particularly referred to by Aubrey, the
antiquary, who says: &ldquo;Before the Reformation, I believe
there was no country or great town in England but had glasse
painters.&nbsp; Old Harding of Blandford in Dorsetshire, where I
went to schoole, was the only country glasse painter that ever I
knew.&nbsp; Upon play daies I was wont to visit <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>his shop and
furnaces.&nbsp; He dyed about 1643, aged about 83 or
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; That craft has long since died out from the

<p>A beautiful backward view of the town is obtained on leaving
it, over the Town Bridge that spans the sluggish, lily-grown
Stour, at the entrance to Lord Portman&rsquo;s noble park of
Bryanstone.&nbsp; Here a dense overarching canopy of trees gives
a grateful shade on summer days and frames the distant prospect
whence the classic tower of the church grandly rises.&nbsp; The
entrance-gates to the domain of Bryanstone are jealously kept
locked and guarded, but there be ways of circumventing this
churlish exclusiveness and of seeing the astonishingly beautiful
scenery of the park, as the present writer has by chance
discovered for himself.&nbsp; You, at the cost of some effort in
hill-climbing, take the defences in the rear, and entering away
back by the farmstead and workshops of the estate, come down by
the finest of the scenery to those selfsame locked gates at these
outskirts of Blandford, to observe and hear with some secret
satisfaction the expressed horror of the lodge-keeper, only too
anxious to let you out and be rid of you.</p>
<p>But, for the unenterprising, there is a sufficiently beautiful
distant view of the park and of the new mansion from the Town
Bridge.&nbsp; A former Lord Portman in 1780 employed James Wyatt
to build him a classic mansion which remained until the rule of
the present owner of the title, who demolished and replaced it
with the fine mansion designed by Norman Shaw, R.A., and built in
red brick and Portland stone.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">THE OLD COACH-ROAD:
BLANDFORD TO DORCHESTER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> this point the old coach-road
becomes astonishingly hilly, so that mere words cannot accurately
portray it, and recourse must be had to the eloquent armoury of
the printer&rsquo;s case to set it forth in any truly convincing
manner.&nbsp; The series of semicircular dumpling hills is not
adequately to be shadowed forth by the aid of mere
brackets&mdash;we must picture them thus:</p>

<p>and, to give some notion of the quality of the surface during
the heats of summer, let a glaring white surface five inches deep
in dust and powdered flint be imagined, the whole stirred up into
a stifling halo of floating particles by the frequent passage of
a flock of sheep.&nbsp; Such is the Exeter Road between Blandford
and Dorchester in the merry months of summer.</p>
<p>Five miles of this bring us to the village of Winterborne
Whitchurch, anciently referred to as &ldquo;Album
Monasterium&rdquo; or &ldquo;Blaunch Minster,&rdquo; situated in
the stony bottom where the little stream called the Winterborne
does not in summer flow across the road.&nbsp; John Wesley,
grandfather of the <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>more famous John, the founder of Methodism, was vicar of
this parish in 1658, and on the Restoration was dispossessed,
when he took to a life of itinerant preaching amid the hills and
dales of Dorsetshire, not altogether dissimilar from that of his
celebrated grandson.&nbsp; Here, about 1540, was born George
Turberville, the poet.&nbsp; To this succeeds, in less than
another three miles, Milborne St. Andrew, on the less dried up
Mill Bourne.&nbsp; This, the &ldquo;Millpond St.
Jude&rsquo;s&rdquo; alluded to in <i>Far from the Madding
Crowd</i>, is a pretty place, of an old-world coaching interest,
reflected from its partly thatched &ldquo;Royal Oak&rdquo; inn
and the post office, once the &ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; with the
imposing effigy of a white hart still prominent on its cornice,
in company with those of two foxes and a row of miniature
cannon.&nbsp; Up along a byroad, past the feathery poplars that
lend so feminine an air of beauty to the village, is the church,
and then the Manor House Farm, once the residence of the Mansell
Pleydells, who since the building of Whatcombe House, near by
Winterborne Whitchurch, in 1758, have left this residence to
farming.&nbsp; The red-brick pillars of the entrance-gates
remain&mdash;partly ruined and standing foolishly, without a
trace of the old carriage drive that once went between
them&mdash;on the grass, surmounted still with sculptured
displays of military trophies surrounding a cartouche bearing the
lichened arms of the Pleydells, including an inescutcheon of
pretence showing that before they allied themselves with a
Mansell they married money with a Morton.&nbsp; It is a fine
house, full of character, with unusually&mdash;and somewhat
foreign-looking&mdash;high-pitched roof.&nbsp; Grand old trees
lead up to it, and in the distance <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>one perceives a manorial
pigeon-house, against the skyline.&nbsp; The old drive led round
to the other side of the mansion, where it is divided from the
meadows by a moatlike cut in the Mill Bourne, now, however,
richer in mud than in water, and crossed by a brick bridge.&nbsp;
We can picture Lady Constantine, the susceptible young and
wealthy widow of the defunct Sir Blount, stealing at night over
this bridge, to visit Swithin St. Cleeve, stargazing in his
lonely tower on the hilltop.&nbsp; In the garden, with its
sundial, are pretty old-world box-edged flower-beds and shady
arbours.&nbsp; Foundations of many demolished buildings are
traceable in the meadows.</p>

<p>The scene of <i>Two on a Tower</i> is a selection from various
places.&nbsp; &ldquo;The tower,&rdquo; Mr. Hardy writes <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>to me,
&ldquo;had two or three originals&mdash;Horton, Charborough,
etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those other places are duly described in these
pages, but the &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; covers the curious brick
obelisk built on the summit of the earthwork-encircled hill near
by this old manor-house of Milborne St. Andrew, and called
Weatherbury Castle.&nbsp; Standing on this &ldquo;fir-shrouded
hilltop,&rdquo; one may see, for many miles around, summer
conflagrations among the furze on Bere Heath, the tall tower in
Charborough Park, which, much more than this obelisk, resembles
Swithin&rsquo;s observatory, and, near at hand, below, this old
manor-house, the &ldquo;Welland House&rdquo; of the story.&nbsp;
From this eyrie, too, you perceive the old Exeter Road swooping
whitely downhill, and hear the hum of threshing-machines, coming
up, like the drowsy buzz of insects, from the vale.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to detect sarcasm in the description of
this hill.&nbsp; It &ldquo;was (according to some <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>antiquaries)
an old Roman camp&mdash;if it were not (as others insisted) an
old British castle, or (as the rest swore) an old Saxon field of
Witanagemote&mdash;with remains of an outer and an inner vallum,
a winding path leading up between their overlapping ends by an
easy ascent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not so easy, really&mdash;indeed, demanding a rather strenuous
climb.&nbsp; And when you are on the crest of that ancient glacis
(impregnable it might well have been when men fought hand to
hand) it is with some difficulty you penetrate the dense woodland
growing within this <i>ceinture</i>.&nbsp; Little can in these
times be seen of the obelisk from without: only from one
particular view-point can you observe its ultimate inches and the
metal ball that caps it, rising mysteriously from amid the
topmost branches of the fir-trees.&nbsp; Its situation is exactly
described in the story: &ldquo;The gloom and solitude which
prevailed round the base were remarkable.&nbsp; The sob of the
environing trees&rdquo; (how like, by the way, to that passage in
Mr. W. S. Gilbert&rsquo;s <i>Ruddigore</i>, &ldquo;the sob of the
breeze is heard in the trees&rdquo;) &ldquo;was here expressively
manifest, and, moved by the light breeze, their thin straight
stems rocked in seconds, like inverted pendulums, while some
boughs and twigs rubbed the pillar&rsquo;s sides, or occasionally
clicked in catching each other.&nbsp; Below the level of their
summits the masonry was lichen-stained and mildewed, for the sun
never pierced that moaning cloud of blue-black vegetation.&nbsp;
Pads of moss grew in the joints of the stonework, and here and
there shade-loving insects had engraved on the mortar patterns of
no human style or meaning, but curious and suggestive.&rdquo;</p>

</a>The why or purpose of this slight brick structure are
lost.&nbsp; The only clue, afforded by the inscription on a stone
tablet set in the lichened bricks, points to it being the
handiwork of a Pleydell.&nbsp; It was, in fact, built by Edmund
Morton Pleydell, but his purpose, if indeed he had one beyond a
singular notion of ornament, has passed, with himself, beyond
these voices; and the neglected condition of the
monument&mdash;if indeed it be a monument&mdash;fully bears out
the moral reflection in <i>Two on a Tower</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
stood this aspiring piece of masonry, erected as the most
conspicuous and ineffaceable reminder of a man that could be
thought of; and yet the whole aspect of the memorial betokened
forgetfulness.&nbsp; Probably not a dozen people within the
district knew the name of the person commemorated, while perhaps
not a soul remembered whether the column were hollow or solid,
whether with or without a tablet explaining its date and
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regaining the high road and passing uphill by where the
Dewlish toll-gate once stood, and by an up-and-down course
infinitely varied as to gradient, we come at length down to the
valley of the Piddle, and to Piddletown, the
&ldquo;Weatherbury&rdquo; of <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>,
where Gabriel Oak, come down in the world by the agency of Fate
and his foolish young sheep-dog, took service with his
distractingly elusive dear, Bathsheba Everdene, the
lady-farmer.&nbsp; Weatherbury, as Mr. Hardy regretfully tells
us, is not the Weatherbury he once knew.&nbsp; It has indeed been
very largely rebuilt, and the rather stern and prim limestone
cottages that stand <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>prominently in one of its several streets do not
altogether prepossess one in favour of this village that is not
quite a townlet and yet may quite possibly resent the more rustic
definition.&nbsp; The &ldquo;several&rdquo; streets are, after
all, rather roads, with rows of houses and cottages less
integrally than incidentally there, and the several are perhaps
reducible to a term less connotive of number; but they run in
unexpected directions and uncovenanted angles, and so make an
imposing show, comparable with the effect produced by six supers
who, by judicious stage-management in passing and repassing, can
be made to represent an army.&nbsp; But the Piddle, running
sparkling and clear through Piddletown, redeems the conjoined
effect of those streets and gives the place a final and
definitive <i>cachet</i> of rurality, by no means belied by the
very large, though very rustic, church&mdash;happily still
unrestored, and, with its tall pews and fine Jacobean carved oak
choir-gallery, a perfect picture of an ancient Wessex place of
worship.&nbsp; Hardean village choirs and Gabriel Oak&rsquo;s
bass voice take, if it be possible, an even greater air of
actuality to the pilgrim who enters here.</p>
<p>The interest of Piddletown church is added to by the fine and
curious bowl font, diapered in an unusual pattern, and by the
tombs of the Martins of Athelhampton, who lie medi&aelig;vally
recumbent in effigy in their own chapel, quite unconcerned,
although scored over with the initials of the undistinguished,
and although their old manor-house of Athelhampton, near by, on
the road to Bere Regis, has since the time they became extinct
passed through several alien hands.&nbsp; Poor old fellows!&nbsp;
Their somewhat threatening motto, under their old <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>monkey crest,
of &ldquo;He who looks at Martin&rsquo;s ape Martin&rsquo;s ape
shall look at him!&rdquo; has lost any point it ever had.</p>

<p>This church of Piddletown, or &ldquo;Weatherbury,&rdquo; is
the scene of Sergeant Troy&rsquo;s belated remorse and of the
acute misery of that incident where, coming by the light of a
lantern and planting flowers on Fanny Robin&rsquo;s grave, he
sleeps in the porch while the rain-storm breaks and the
storm-water from the gurgoyles of the tower spouts furiously over
the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The persistent torrent from the gurgoyle&rsquo;s jaws
directed all its vengeance into the grave.&nbsp; The rich tawny
mould was stirred into motion, and boiled like chocolate.&nbsp;
The water accumulated and washed deeper down, and the roar of the
pool thus formed spread into the night. . . .&nbsp; The flowers
so carefully planted by Fanny&rsquo;s repentant lover began to
move and writhe in their bed.&nbsp; The winter-violets turned
slowly upside down, and became a mere mat of mud.&nbsp; Soon the
snowdrops and other bulbs danced in the boiling mass like
ingredients in a cauldron.&nbsp; Plants of the tufted species
were loosened, rose to the surface, and floated off.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>The
street beside the church retains a good deal of its quaint
features of thatch and plaster, with deep eaves where the
house-martins build.&nbsp; A pretty corner including an old
thatched house with architectonic windows closely resembling
those of a Queen Anne bureau, and supported on pillars having a
cousinship with classic art, is especially noticeable.</p>

<p>If we wish to see the old mansion that served as model for
Bathsheba&rsquo;s farm, we shall not find it in Piddletown, but
must turn aside and proceed up the valley of the Piddle, in the
direction of Piddlehinton and Piddletrenthide&mdash;usually
termed &ldquo;Longpiddle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before reaching these, at
the distance of rather over a mile, we come to Lower Walterstone,
where, behind noble groups of beeches, horse-chestnuts, and
sycamores growing on raised <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>grassy banks, it will be found, in
the shape of a Jacobean mansion eloquently portrayed by the
novelist:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By daylight, the bower of Oak&rsquo;s new-found
mistress, Bathsheba Everdene, presented itself as a hoary
building, of the Jacobean stage of Classic Renaissance as regards
its architecture, and of a proportion which told at a glance
that, as is so frequently the case, it had once been the manorial
hall upon a small estate around it, now altogether effaced as a
distinct property, and merged in the vast tract of a non-resident
landlord which comprised several such modest demesnes.&nbsp;
Fluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone, decorated its
front, and above the roof pairs of chimneys were here and there
linked by an arch, some gables and other unmanageable features
still retaining traces of their Gothic extraction.&nbsp; Soft
brown mosses, like faded velveteen, formed cushions upon the
stone tiling, and tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted
from the eaves of the low surrounding buildings.&nbsp; A gravel
walk leading from the door to the road in front was incrusted at
the sides with more moss&mdash;here it was a silver-green
variety, the nut-brown of the gravel being visible to the width
of only a foot or two in the centre.&nbsp; This circumstance, and
the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect here, together
with the animated and contrasting state of the reverse
fa&ccedil;ade, suggested to the imagination that, on the
adaptation of the building for farming purposes, the vital
principle of the house had turned round inside its body, to face
the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way from Piddletown to Dorchester, passing <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the hamlet
singularly and interestingly named &ldquo;Troy Town,&rdquo;
which, although itself intrinsically without visible interest,
invites speculation, presently passes over Yellowham Hill,
clothed in luxuriant woods.&nbsp; This spot, the &ldquo;Yalbury
Hill&rdquo; of Troy&rsquo;s excruciatingly pitiful meeting with
Fanny Robin, figures, together with the woodlands&mdash;the
&ldquo;Yalbury Great Wood&rdquo; of <i>Under the Greenwood
Tree</i>&mdash;in several others among the Wessex stories.&nbsp;
Coming to it in old times, the coaches changed horses at the
&ldquo;Buck&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; inn, now quite disestablished and
forgot, save for the humorous description of it to be found in
the pages of <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>.&nbsp;
Unswervingly the highway passes over its crest and down on the
other side, the wayfarer along <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>it watched by bright-eyed squirrels
and the other lesser fauna of this dense covert, while he thinks
himself unobserved.&nbsp; It is a lovely road, but you should see
it and its encompassing woods in autumn, when the October
sunshine, with that characteristic golden sheen peculiar to the
time of year, falls between the rich red trunks of the firs on to
the golden-brown of the dried bracken; when the acorns are ripe
on the dwarf oaks and fall with startling little crashes into the
sere leaves of the undergrowth; when the nuts are ripe on the
hazels and the squirrels&mdash;too busy now to follow the
wayfarer&rsquo;s movements&mdash;are industriously all day long
gathering store of them over against winter.&nbsp; Then Yellowham
Woods are at their finest.</p>

<p>Where the descent from this eminence reaches an intermediate
level, preparatory to diving again downwards, the road takes a
curve through the park-lands of Kingston House, a stately but
cold-looking mansion of stone, figuring in that first novel,
<i>Desperate Remedies</i>, as &ldquo;Knapwater
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bias of the architect, as he then was, is
prominently displayed in Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s description of it:
&ldquo;The house was regularly and substantially built of clean
grey freestone throughout, in that plainer fashion of Greek
classicism which prevailed at the latter end of the last century,
when the copyists called designers had grown weary of fantastic
variations in the Roman orders.&nbsp; The main block approximated
to a square on the ground plan, having a projection in the centre
of each side, surmounted by a pediment.&nbsp; From each angle of
the north side ran a line of buildings lower than the rest,
turning inwards again at their farthest end, and <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>forming
within them a spacious open court, within which resounded an echo
of astounding clearness.&nbsp; These erections were in their turn
backed by ivy-covered ice-houses, laundries, and stables, the
whole mass of subsidiary buildings being half buried beneath
close-set shrubs and trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving aside, for the present, an exploration of Stinsford,
down the next turning, to come later to a particular and intimate
discussion of it, we proceed to Dorchester, whose houses, and
those of its allied suburb of Fordington, are now seen, crowning
the ridge on which the old county town stands.</p>
<h2><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">DORCHESTER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorchester</span>, the
&ldquo;Casterbridge&rdquo; of the novels, stands upon or, more
correctly, above, the River Frome, and from that circumstance
derived its ancient Roman name of Durnovaria, whose Latinity Mr.
Hardy has exploited in the name of &ldquo;Durnover&rdquo; he
confers upon Fordington.&nbsp; The Romans themselves did by no
means invent their name for the station they founded here, but
just adapted the title given by the native tribe of Durotriges to
their settlement.&nbsp; Those natives, who were of Welsh stock,
styled their habitation by the sufficiently Welsh name of
Dwrinwyr, which, like all Cymric place-names, was descriptive and
alluded to its watery situation.</p>
<p>The approach to Dorchester has suffered in late years, in the
pictorial point of view, from the decay and destruction of many
of those magnificent old elms that once formed a noble
introduction along this, the &ldquo;London Road&rdquo;; but it is
not wholly to be bankrupted of beauty, for, although Dorchester
may continue to grow, it is not in this direction that its
suburbs will be thrown out.&nbsp; The flat water-meadows of the
Frome forbid building operations here, and in effect say, at the
bridge <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>immediately below where Fordington on its ridge stands
on the thitherward bank of the stream&mdash;&ldquo;thus far and
no farther!&rdquo;&nbsp; From this approach, looking to where
Fordington&rsquo;s houses die away on the left hand, and to where
the chalky downs begin to rise, you may obtain a distant view of
the novelist&rsquo;s residence, a house he himself designed,
standing beside the Wareham Road near where an old turnpike-gate
stood, and called from it &ldquo;Max Gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Looking,
however, straight ahead, the road into Dorchester is seen
becoming a street and going with inflexible Roman directness
through the town, with the ancient church tower of Fordington
slightly to the left, and the equally ancient church of St.
Peter&rsquo;s immediately in front, in the centre of the town,
where the two main streets cross.&nbsp; Attendant modern churches
and chapels, and the Town Hall, with spires, act as
satellites.&nbsp; To the right hand, rising bulky from the
huddled mass of houses, is a grey building which but a little
experience of touring in England identifies without need of
inquiry as the gaol.</p>
<p>Dorchester, figuring as the &ldquo;Casterbridge&rdquo; of that
mayor whose surprising history is set forth in that powerful
story, bulks large in the whole series of Wessex novels&mdash;as
how could it fail of doing, seeing that the novelist himself was
born at Upper Bockhampton, only three miles away?&nbsp; In
masterly fashion he has described its salient points, as they
were before modernity had come to obliterate them, or at least to
take off the sharp edge of their singularity.&nbsp; He has
expended much thought upon Roman Dorchester, and speculated upon
what manner of place it was fifteen hundred years ago.&nbsp; <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;Casterbridge announced old Rome in every street,
alley, and precinct.&nbsp; It looked Roman, bespoke the art of
Rome, concealed dead men of Rome.&nbsp; It was impossible to dig
more than a foot or two deep about the town fields and gardens
without coming upon some tall soldier or other of the Empire, who
had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a space of
fifteen hundred years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, even within the
precincts of his own garden, on the edge of the rotund upland
that looks so wanly down upon the railway, relics of the
legionaries have been discovered.&nbsp; Three of those stout
warriors were there found.&nbsp; &ldquo;Each body was fitted
with, one may almost say, perfect accuracy into the oval hole,
the crown of the head touching the maiden chalk at one end and
the toes at the other, the tight-fitting situation being strongly
suggestive of the chicken in the egg-shell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More attuned to modern times is that description of Dorchester
as it appeared when Susan, Henchard&rsquo;s wife, with
Elizabeth-Jane, entered it from the London Road that
evening.&nbsp; Wonderfully observed and true is that passage
where the light of the street lamps, glimmering through those
engirdling trees that were then, even more than now, the great
feature of the town, is made a snug and comforting contrast with
the outside country, seeming &ldquo;strangely solitary and vacant
in aspect, considering its nearness to life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
the agricultural and pastoral pursuits of the people, as
reflected in the character of the goods displayed in shop
windows, is neatly shown, in a list of those objects: the
hay-rakes, the seed-lips, butter-firkins, hoes and spades and
mattocks; the horse-embrocations, <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>scythes, reaping-hooks, and
hedger&rsquo;s and ditcher&rsquo;s gloves, articles all of
everyday requirement.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;grizzled church&rdquo; to which they came was St.
Peter&rsquo;s, whose tower showed &ldquo;how completely the
mortar from the joints of the stonework had been nibbled out by
time and weather, which had planted in the crevices thus made
little tufts of stone-crop and grass, almost as far up as the
very battlements.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, and so one vividly remembers
it; but restoration has recently made away with all these
evidences of age, and cleaned the stonework and renewed and
pointed it, greatly to the aid of the tower&rsquo;s structural
stability, &rsquo;tis true, but the very death of picturesque
effect.&nbsp; There is a pleasing thing here, at the foot of this
tower, where High East Street and High West Street join.&nbsp; It
is the bronze life-sized statue, in his habit as he lived, of
&ldquo;Pa&rsquo;son Barnes,&rdquo; otherwise the Reverend William
Barnes, the Dorset poet, described by Thomas Hardy as he is
represented here&mdash;&ldquo;an aged clergyman, quaintly attired
in caped cloak, knee-breeches and buckled shoes, with a leather
satchel slung over his shoulders and a stout staff in his
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; This quaint figure, whose life and thoughts
and writings were racy of the soil whence he sprang&mdash;he was
born in the Vale of Blackmore&mdash;was for many years a quite
inadequately rewarded schoolmaster, and only late in life was
given, first the living of Whitcomb, and then that of Winterborne
Came, near Dorchester.&nbsp; His poems in the Dorsetshire
vernacular, long known and admired, were not pecuniarily
successful.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a mockery is life!&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;They praise me, and take away my bread!&nbsp;
They may be putting up a statue to me <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>some day, when I am dead, while all I
want now is leave to live.&nbsp; I asked for bread, and they gave
me a stone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prophetic indeed! for here is the statue, with beneath it the
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">WILLIAM BARNES<br />
1801&ndash;1886</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the quotation from one of his own folk-poems:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zoo now I hope his kindly f&euml;ace<br />
Is gone to vind a better pl&euml;ace,<br />
But still wi&rsquo; vo&rsquo;k a&rsquo; left behind<br />
He&rsquo;ll always be a kept in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mural monument of a sixteenth-century Thomas Hardy, within
the church, attracts attention.&nbsp; The inscription states him
to have been &ldquo;esquire&rdquo; and of Melcombe Regis, and
goes on to describe his benefactions to the town and the
gratitude of the &ldquo;Baylives and Burgisses&rdquo;
therefor.&nbsp; To &ldquo;commend to posterity an example soe
worthy of imitation,&rdquo; they erected this tablet.&nbsp; He is
said to be the common ancestor of Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, the
friend and comrade of Nelson, and of Thomas Hardy, the
novelist.</p>
<p>Still from this tower of St. Peter&rsquo;s sounds the curfew
chime, with the stroke of eight o&rsquo;clock every evening, as
described in the story; its &ldquo;peremptory clang&rdquo; the
signal for shop-shutting throughout the town.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other
clocks struck eight from time to time&mdash;one gloomily from the
gaol, another from the gable of an alms-house, with a preparative
creak of machinery more audible than the note of the
bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>In High
East Street stands, just as described, the principal inn&mdash;I
suppose in these times one should, for fear of disrespect say
&ldquo;hotel&rdquo;&mdash;of Dorchester, the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Arms,&rdquo; white-faced, with the selfsame &ldquo;spacious
bow-window projected into the street over the main
portico,&rdquo; the whole not too imposing for comfort, and not
too homely for dignity.&nbsp; It was a coaching house in days
gone by.&nbsp; From a step above the pavement on the opposite
side of the street Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, amid the crowd,
witnessed the dinner given to the mayor, and through the archway
Boldwood carried Bathsheba, fainting at the news of her
husband&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Equally white-faced, but a good deal more picturesque, is the
&ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; down at the end, or the beginning if
you will, of the sloping street, as you enter the town.&nbsp; By
it runs the Frome, and in its courtyard on market-days may be
seen such a concourse of carriers&rsquo; carts as rarely
witnessed nowadays.&nbsp; Dorchester is a busy carrying centre,
by no means spoiled in that respect by railways, which yet fail
to reach many of its surrounding villages.</p>
<p>The brick bridge that here spans the Frome, and the stone
bridge some distance farther away, spanning a branch of the same
stream out away in the meads, have their parts in the <i>Mayor of
Casterbridge</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;These bridges had speaking
countenances.&nbsp; Every projection in each was worn down to
obtuseness, partly by weather, more by friction from generations
of loungers, whose toes and heels had from year to year made
restless movements against these parapets, as they had stood
there, meditating on the aspect of affairs.&nbsp; In the case <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>of the more
pliable bricks and stones, even the flat faces were worn into
hollows by the same mixed mechanism.&nbsp; The masonry of the top
was clamped with iron at each joint; since it had been no
uncommon thing for desperate men to wrench the coping off and
throw it down into the river, in reckless defiance of the
magistrates.&nbsp; For to this pair of bridges gravitated all the
failures of the town&mdash;those who had failed in business, in
love, in sobriety, in crime.&nbsp; Why the unhappy hereabout
usually chose the bridges for their meditations in preference to
a railing, a gate, or a stile, was not so clear.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
goes on to tell how there was a marked difference in quality
between the frequenters of the near bridge of brick and the far
one of stone.&nbsp; The more thoroughgoing failures and those
with the most threadbare characters, or with no characters at
all, save bad ones, preferred the near bridge: to reach it
entailed less trouble, and it was not for such as them to mind
the glare of publicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>mis&eacute;rables</i> who would pause on the
remoter bridge were of a politer stamp.&nbsp; They included
bankrupts, hypochondriacs, persons who were what is called
&lsquo;out of a situation&rsquo; from fault or lucklessness, the
inefficient of the professional class&mdash;shabby-genteel men,
who did not know how to get rid of the weary time between
breakfast and dinner, and the yet more weary time between dinner
and dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; These unfortunates gazed steadily into the
river, never turning to notice passers-by, and indeed shrinking
from observation.&nbsp; And so day by day they looked and looked
in the stream, until at last their bodies were sometimes found in
it.</p>

<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>When
Henchard&rsquo;s ruin was complete, he too began to frequent the
stone bridge, and would have ended in the same way, not at the
bridge itself, but over in the meadows where the many branches of
the Frome are regulated and controlled by a number of sluices
known as Ten Hatches.&nbsp; &ldquo;To the east of Casterbridge
lay moors and meadows, through which much water flowed.&nbsp; The
wanderer in this direction, who should stand still for a few
moments on a quiet night, might hear singular symphonies from
these waters, as from a lampless orchestra, all playing in their
sundry tones, from near and far parts of the moor.&nbsp; At a
hole in a rotten weir they executed a recitative; where a
tributary brook fell over a stone breastwork they trilled
cheerily; under an arch they performed a metallic cymballing; and
at Durnover Weir they hissed.&nbsp; The spot at which their
instrumentation rose loudest was a place called Ten Hatches,
whence during high springs there proceeded a very fugue of
sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruined mayor, to whom, and not the cold, successful Donald
Farfrae, the reader&rsquo;s sympathies go out, would have ended
all his troubles here with a plunge in the waters, had it not
been for the ghastly floating Skimmington effigy of himself he
saw floating down the current as he was about to drop in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gray&rsquo;s Bridge,&rdquo; as the stone structure on
the London Road is known, is that toward which Bob Loveday, in
the <i>Trumpet Major</i>, gazed anxiously, awaiting the coach
bearing his Matilda, and across it, of course, on their way to
Longpiddle, went those &ldquo;Crusted Characters,&rdquo; telling
stories in the carrier&rsquo;s <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>cart jogging along with them so
comfortably from the &ldquo;White Hart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fateful, almost sentient, character many natural objects
are made to assume in the march of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s tragic
stories is expressly shown in his description of the Roman
amphitheatre of Maumbury, at the farther or western extremity of
Dorchester, beside the road to Weymouth.&nbsp; He styles it
&ldquo;the Ring, on the Budmouth Road,&rdquo; and explains how
&ldquo;it was to Casterbridge what the ruined Coliseum is to
modern Rome, and was nearly of the same magnitude.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is not, as might be gathered from this passage, a building,
like the Coliseum, but a vast amphitheatre formed by
earthworks.&nbsp; Used by the Romans as the scene of their
gladiatorial displays, it has doubtless witnessed many an act of
savage cruelty, but is now a solitude.&nbsp; A sinister place it
has been always, for, when executions were public affairs, the
gallows stood within the old arena; and until well into the
eighteenth century the populace came to it in thousands to
witness the execution of felons where, before the dawn of the
Christian era, fighting men had struggled to the death: where
perhaps, in early Christian times, in the days of the Diocletian
persecution, Christians had been sacrificed.&nbsp; It was here,
in 1705, that Mary Channing was executed, under the most fearful
circumstances of barbarity belonging to the penalties prescribed
for <i>petit treason</i>.&nbsp; The crimes known by that name
included several forms of rebellion against authority, among them
the murder of a husband by a wife.&nbsp; A husband being then,
much more than now, in the eyes of the law in a position of
authority over his wife, to murder <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>him was not merely murder&mdash;it
was <i>petit treason</i> as well, and therefore deserving of
exceptional punishment.&nbsp; Mary Brookes, married by the wish
of her parents, against her own inclination, to one Richard
Channing of Dorchester, a grocer, almost ruined him by her
extravagance, and then poisoned him by giving him white mercury,
first in rice-milk, and twice afterwards in a glass of
wine.&nbsp; At the Summer Assizes, 1704, she was found guilty and
condemned to death.&nbsp; On March 21st, 1705, accordingly, she
was strangled here, in this arena, and then burned, the horrible
spectacle being witnessed by ten thousand persons.&nbsp; She was
but nineteen years of age.&nbsp; This Golgotha was disestablished
in 1767, when the gallows was removed to the decent solitudes of
Bradford Down, a mile and a half along the Exeter Road, on the
way to Bridport.&nbsp; It was to this spot that a mayor of
Dorchester desired to escort a distinguished traveller leaving
the town, after being presented with the customary address.&nbsp;
&ldquo;May I be allowed to accompany your Highness as far as the
gallows?&rdquo; he asked, greatly to the dismay of that departing
Serenity, to whom the allusion seemed more ill-omened than really
it was.&nbsp; It is a tale told of many places and many mayors,
and he would be a clever commentator who should distinguish the
real original.</p>
<p>The lone amphitheatre of Maumbury has thus, it will be seen,
real tragical associations fitting it for the novelist&rsquo;s
more sombre humours.&nbsp; He tells how intrigues were there
carried forward, how furtive and sinister meetings happened
within the rim of these ancient earthworks, and how, although <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the patching
up of long-standing feuds might be attempted on this spot, seldom
had it been the place of meeting of happy lovers.&nbsp; In this
ring, then, the reconciliation of Susan and Henchard took place,
after eighteen years, and was but the prelude to miseries and
disasters.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">DORCHESTER
(<i>continued</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Henchard&rsquo;s</span>
house&mdash;&ldquo;one of the best, faced with dull red-and-grey
old brick,&rdquo; there are many such here&mdash;was in the
neighbourhood of North Street, and not far from that Corn
Exchange where Bathsheba was wont, on market days, to mingle with
the burly farmers and corn-factors, like a yacht among ironclads,
displaying for inspection the sample wheat in her outstretched
palm.</p>
<p>Down here, too, is the gaol, whose mass is seen from the meads
on approaching the town.&nbsp; It has been much altered, but the
heavy stone gateway, together with the flanking walls of red
brick, is very much as of old.&nbsp; Happily, such things as are
noticed in that gruesome short story, <i>The Withered Arm</i>,
are things only of dreadful memory.&nbsp; At that time the
populace of Dorchester were accustomed to wait below in the
meadows, eager to witness the executioner, the
criminals&mdash;murderers, burglars, rick-firers, sheep and
horse-stealers, even down to those convicted of petty
larceny&mdash;being capitally condemned and hanged as high as,
possibly indeed higher than, Haman, whose place of suspension is
notoriously and traditionally lofty.&nbsp; Gertrude Lodge, coming
here for the cure of her withered arm by <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the agency of
the dead man&rsquo;s touch, observed, as all could then not help
observing, those &ldquo;three rectangular lines against the
sky,&rdquo; which indicated the coming execution and the
morrow&rsquo;s exhibition, to be followed by the merry-makings of
Hang Fair.&nbsp; When she enquired the hour of execution, she was
told: &ldquo;The same as usual&mdash;twelve o&rsquo;clock, or as
soon after as the London mail-coach gets in.&nbsp; We always wait
for that, in case of a reprieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>In Dorchester Gaol&mdash;we have no space here for those
merely actual persons of flesh and blood who have been
incarcerated, or who have suffered in it&mdash;those more real
characters of fiction, Boldwood and Marston were confined; and
hence the Shottsford watchmaker of <i>The Three Strangers</i>,
lying under sentence of death, escaped along the downs to Higher
Crowstairs, where, while sheltering in the <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>ingle-nook of
the cottage, two other strangers, one of them the hangman deputed
to execute the demands of the law upon him on the morrow, take
shelter from the weather.</p>
<p>To follow this gloomy train a little longer, the veritable
Hangman&rsquo;s Cottage, home of this erstwhile busy functionary,
at a time when Dorchester demanded the whole time and energies of
a Jack Ketch, and not a very occasional visit from one common to
the whole kingdom, may be seen, at the foot of Glydepath Lane, in
a fine damp situation near the river.&nbsp; It is one of a tiny
group of heavily thatched old rustic cottages built of grouted
flint and chalk, faced and patched with red brick, and held
together with iron ties, so that in their old age they shall not,
some night, altogether collapse and deposit their inhabitants
among the potatoes, the peas, and cabbages of their fertile
gardens.&nbsp; Dorchester paid its hangman a regular salary, and
in the intervals between his more important business, he was
under engagement to perform those minor punishments of whipping
and scourging, of putting in the stocks, and of pillorying, by
whose plentiful administration Old England was made the
&ldquo;Merry England&rdquo; of our forefathers.&nbsp; Let not the
reader, however, seek a covert satire here.&nbsp; It is not to be
gainsaid that it was a &ldquo;Merry England,&rdquo; for the times
were so brutal that, in all such degrading and pitiful spectacles
as these, the populace took the keenest delight.&nbsp; Sufficient
for the day&mdash;! and those who made merry did not stop to
consider that they who were now spectators might soon very likely
afford in their own persons the same spectacle.</p>
<p>Miserable times!&nbsp; Proof of them, do you need <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>seek it, is
to be found in the Dorchester Museum, where the leaden weights,
boldly inscribed &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">MERCY</span>,&rdquo; are pointed out as the
contribution, years ago, of an exceptionally tender-hearted
governor of the gaol to a more pitiful method of ending the
condemned man who was to die for his crime of arson.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image77" href="images/p77.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Hangman&rsquo;s Cottage, Dorchester"

</a></p>
<p>The man was of unusually light weight, and, as those were the
times when men really were slowly and painfully hanged and choked
by degrees, before criminals were given a drop and their necks
broken, it was thought a kindly thing on the part of this
governor that he <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>should have provided these heavy weights, to attach to
this particular victim&rsquo;s feet and so help to shorten his
misery.</p>
<p>This museum it was that Lucetta, keen to get the girl out of
the way, suggested for Elizabeth Jane&rsquo;s entertainment; with
affected enthusiasm and a good deal of veiled womanly sarcasm at
the expense of antiquities, describing how it contained
&ldquo;crowds of interesting things&mdash;skeletons, teeth, old
pots and pans, ancient boots and shoes, birds&rsquo;
eggs&mdash;all charmingly instructive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But enough of such things, let us to other quarters.</p>
<p>Looking on to the cheerful and prosperous South Street from
the corner of Durngate Street is the substantial &ldquo;grey
fa&ccedil;ade&rdquo; of Lucetta&rsquo;s house, where lived
Henchard&rsquo;s lady-love, whose affections were so readily
transferable.&nbsp; The lower portion of this, the &ldquo;High
Place Hall&rdquo; of the story, has suffered a transformation
into business premises, but the resounding alleyways of Durngate
Street and neighbouring lanes are as gloomy as those spots are
described.&nbsp; &ldquo;At night the forms of passengers were
patterned by the lamps in black shadows upon the pale
walls,&rdquo; and so they are still.</p>
<p>But the description of Lucetta&rsquo;s house in those pages is
a composite picture; a good deal of it deriving from an old
mansion in another part of the town.&nbsp; This will be found by
taking a narrow thoroughfare leading out of the north side of
High West Street, and called, in different parts of its course,
Glydepath Lane and Glydepath Street.&nbsp; In this quiet byway is
the early eighteenth-century mansion known as Colyton House,
sometime a town <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>residence of the Churchill family, and so named from the
little Devonshire town of Colyton, near which is situated Ash,
that old dwelling, now a farmhouse, whence the historic
Churchills sprang.</p>
<p>Readily to be seen, in a blank wall, is the long-filled-in
archway, with the dreadful keystone mask, alluded to in the pages
of <i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image79" href="images/p79.jpg">
<img alt=
"Colyton House, Dorchester"
title=
"Colyton House, Dorchester"
 src="images/p79.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Originally the mask had exhibited a comic leer, as
could still be discerned; but generations of Casterbridge boys
had thrown stones at the mask, aiming at its open mouth; and the
blows thereof had chipped off the lips and jaws as if they had
been eaten away by disease.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its appearance is indeed
of a ghastly leprous nature, infinitely shuddery.</p>
<p>At this end of the town, out upon the Charminster road is the
great Roman encampment of Poundbury, or, locally,
&ldquo;Pummery,&rdquo; where Henchard spread <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>that feast,
deserted by those for whom it was intended, in favour of the
rival entertainment in the West Walks, prepared by the hateful
Farfrae, that paragon of all the business and higher virtues,
whom the reader perversely, but not unnaturally, detests.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Roman&rdquo; it has been in this last passage declared,
but, in truth, its origin has been as widely disputed as that of
Weatherbury Castle, where the varying theories arouse Mr.
Hardy&rsquo;s sarcasm so markedly.&nbsp; It lies without the site
of the Roman walls of Durnovaria, and probably formed some
advanced outpost or great camp in the long years of the Roman
occupation of Britain, before the establishment of security and
the growth of their towns.&nbsp; Those Roman walls are now for
the most part gone and their sites were long ago planted with
avenues, now growing aged and past their prime, and ceased to be
that clean-cut barrier between <i>urbs</i> and <i>rure</i> they
formed of old, when Dorchester of pre-railway days had not grown
too big for that girdle the Romans had set about her: a girdle
not too constrictive for the needs of the Middle Age, nor even in
the eighteenth century with any suspicion of tight-lacing, but
all too compressive soon after the coaches had given way to
trains, and steel rails and steam along them had sent up the
birthrate.&nbsp; A notable passage in <i>The Mayor of
Casterbridge</i> tells how there were not, quite a little while
ago, any suburbs here, in the modern sense, nor any gradual
fusion of town and country.&nbsp; &ldquo;The farmer&rsquo;s boy
could sit under his barleymow, and pitch a stone into the window
of the town-clerk; reapers at work among the sheaves nodded to
acquaintances standing on the pavement-corner; the red-robed
judge, when <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>he condemned a sheep stealer, pronounced sentence to the
tune of &lsquo;Baa,&rsquo; that floated in at the window from the
remainder of the flock browsing hard by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But those bounds have in several places been leaped, and, in
especial where the South Walk runs, modern villas have redly
replaced the golden grain or the green pastures.&nbsp; Changed
manners and customs have brought about this alteration, quite as
much as increased population.&nbsp; The four old traditional
streets of the town, together with their more immediate
offshoots, have been resigned more exclusively to business than
of yore, and made less a residence.&nbsp; The butchers, the
bakers, the candlestick-makers, who would once have scorned to
live anywhere else than over &ldquo;the shop,&rdquo; will now not
very often condescend to make their homes in the upper stages of
their &ldquo;stores&rdquo; or &ldquo;establishments,&rdquo; or by
what other pretty names modern finesse elects to describe shops
and counters and tills and such like things by which tradespeople
become rich.</p>
<p>And, by that same token, the business premises thus deserted
for snug suburban villas, are themselves changing.&nbsp; One
could never, in modern times, have strictly called Dorchester
generally picturesque, in the prominent circumstances of those
four main streets: repeated conflagrations that destroyed most of
the really old and interesting houses forbade that, and replaced
thatch and barge-boarded gables with plain brick fronts, severe
in unornamental rectangular windows, and ending on the skyline
with unimaginative straight copings.&nbsp; But the latest
manifestations of these times, when they say business is a
struggle and all trades alike carried on less for the profit of
the purveyor, than for the good of <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>the purchaser, are expensive carved
stone and brick frontages, with good artistic features.&nbsp; As
art in this country only spells much expenditure of good money
and as building operations are always costly, it is a little
difficult to square all these developments with the talk of
&ldquo;hard times.&rdquo;&nbsp; South Street, in especial, is
being grandly transformed, and &ldquo;Napper&rsquo;s Mite,&rdquo;
the crouching row of almshouses, built from the benefaction of
the good Sir Robert Napper, in 1615, made to look additionally
humble by newly risen tall buildings.&nbsp; But the town
authorities have not yet removed the old rusticated stone obelisk
that stands in Cornhill, in the centre of the town, where High
East and High West Streets, and North and South Streets
meet.&nbsp; It serves the multum-in-parvo purposes of a pump, a
lamp-standard, and a leaning-stock for Dorchester&rsquo;s weary
or born-tired, and is moreover a landmark.&nbsp; But the two
dumpy little houses at the corner, which were properly dumpy and
humble and&mdash;so to speak&mdash;knew their place, and abased
themselves in the presence of their betters&mdash;that is to say,
in the contiguity of St. Peter&rsquo;s across the road&mdash;have
been rebuilt, with the result that their tall upstanding
pretentiousness detracts not a little from the height of that
&ldquo;grizzled tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, turning to the left at this corner, we leave
Dorchester for Bridport, along High West Street, the quietest of
all these thoroughfares, and looking rather &ldquo;out of
it,&rdquo; and somewhat glad of that fact, in a dignified,
exclusive way, typified by its aristocratic old houses, and its
old County Hall.&nbsp; It is true there are a few shops in High
Street, but they are by no means pushful shops.&nbsp; They <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>never make
&ldquo;alarming sacrifices,&rdquo; nor sell off.&nbsp; Indeed,
were I not fearful of offending susceptibility, I might declare a
belief that they never sell anything at all, and are kept by
&ldquo;grown-ups,&rdquo; not grown tired of playing at shops when
they did so arrive at years supposed to be those of
discretion.&nbsp; Here is a quiet shop&mdash;where they will
doubtless sell you something, if you really enter and firmly
insist upon it&mdash;occupying one of the few really old and
picturesque houses in the main thoroughfare; it is the house
&ldquo;by tradition&rdquo; occupied by the infamous Judge
Jeffreys, when visiting Dorchester on the business of that
special occasion, the Bloody Assize, holden to try the unhappy
wretches arraigned for their part in Monmouth&rsquo;s Rebellion
of 1685.&nbsp; The old house bears an inscription to this
effect.&nbsp; Over three hundred prisoners faced the judge at
that awful time, and two hundred and ninety received sentence of
death.&nbsp; Of these the number actually executed was
seventy-four, and, as the old gossip at the &ldquo;Three
Mariners&rdquo; tells, portions of their bodies were gibbeted in
various parts of the county, &ldquo;different j&rsquo;ints sent
about the country like butcher&rsquo;s meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we leave Dorchester and its, on the whole, grim
memories, along an avenue, fellow to that by which the town was
entered.</p>
<h2><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">SWANAGE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of Swanage shares with
that of Swansea, the honour of being, perhaps, the most poetic
that any seaside resort ever owned.&nbsp; It is a corruption of
the Danish name of &ldquo;Swanic,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Swanwich,&rdquo; and there seems to be no reason to
doubt&mdash;although there exists a school of antiquarians
sceptical enough to doubt it&mdash;that the place was then, as
its name indicates, a place of swans.&nbsp; Your modern
antiquary, disgusted at the childish legends once everywhere
accepted as sober historical facts, rushes to the other extreme,
and, although a thing be obvious, will not allow its obviousness,
unless supported by documentary or other tangible evidence.&nbsp;
He must needs disregard the self-evident, and delve deeply and
unavailingly in attempts to prove that &ldquo;things are not what
they seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conjectures that there was at that time a royal swannery here
are based upon the known fondness of royal personages for
preserving that bird, once thought a table delicacy, and upon the
existence from ancient times of the famous Abbotsbury swannery,
along this same coast.&nbsp; But it is needless here to labour
the point; and although the little stream, more and more
pollutedly with every year <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>of the extension of modern Swanage,
still flows down into the sea under the name of the Swan Brook,
the argument supported by it in favour of the obvious origin of
the place-name shall be no further pursued.</p>
<p>But the surrounding quarries have for many centuries past
given a very different character to Swanage than that of a
village with a marshy creek inhabited by swans.&nbsp; Few places
ever proclaimed the industries by which they lived more
prominently than did this little port, until well within recent
recollection.&nbsp; A colliery town no more insistently obtrudes
the circumstances by which it earns its livelihood than Swanage
displayed evidences of its cleanly trade and craft of
stone-working and stone-exporting.</p>
<p>The varieties of stone from the quarries to the rear of
Swanage are among the most famous building and decorative stones
in the world; for here we are at the gates of Isle of Purbeck,
where, not only the oolitic limestone of the same nature as
&ldquo;Portland stone&rdquo; is quarried, but that (to
antiquaries at least) far more generally known material,
&ldquo;Purbeck marble,&rdquo; as well.&nbsp; No ancient church or
cathedral of any considerable size or elaboration was considered
complete without shafts and font and other decorative features of
Purbeck marble, sometimes polished, at other times left in its
native state; and thus, from very early times until the beginning
of the sixteenth century, when more strikingly coloured and
patterned foreign marbles began to find their way into England,
Swanage in particular, and Purbeck in general, enjoyed an amazing
prosperity.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Swanage
in Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s pages is &ldquo;Knollsea,&rdquo; and is
described in <i>The Hand of Ethelberta</i> as a
village:&mdash;&ldquo;Knollsea,&rdquo; we learn, &ldquo;was a
seaside village lying snug within two headlands, as between a
finger and thumb.&rdquo;&nbsp; A very true simile, as a glance on
the map, upon the configuration of Swanage Bay, will satisfy
those curious in the exactness or otherwise of literary
images.&nbsp; But time has very rapidly vitiated the justness of
what follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Everybody in the parish who was not a
boatman was a quarrier, unless he were the gentleman who owned
half the property and had been a quarryman, or the other
gentleman who owned the other half and had been to
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knowledge of the inhabitants was of the same
special sort as their pursuits.&nbsp; The quarrymen in white
fustian understood practical geology, the laws and accidents of
dips, faults, and cleavage, far better than the ways of the world
and mammon; the seafaring men, in Guernsey frocks, had a clearer
notion of Alexandria, Constantinople, the Cape, and the Indies
than of any inland town in their own country.&nbsp; This, for
them, consisted of a busy portion, the Channel, where they lived
and laboured, and a dull portion, the vague unexplored miles of
interior at the back of the ports, which they seldom thought
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This charming picture of an out-of-the world place remained,
very little blurred by change, until well on into the
&rsquo;80&rsquo;s of the nineteenth century, when it occurred to
exploiting railway folk that the time was ripe for the
construction of a branch railway from Wareham.&nbsp; With the
opening of that line the primitive houses, and the equally <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>primitive
people who lived in them, suffered a change almost as sudden and
complete as though a harlequin had waved his wand over their
heads.</p>
<p>There was indeed something exceptionally primitive in the
Swanage people.&nbsp; They were chiefly quarrymen, and like all
quarry folk, mining the great blocks of stone from mother earth,
a strangely reserved and isolated race.&nbsp; A man who, felling
timber, might conceivably remain all his life mentally detached
from his occupation, following it only mechanically, could not
long in these quarries, rich in the embalmed stoniness of myriads
of humble creatures living in the pal&aelig;ozoic age, remain
unaffected by his surroundings.&nbsp; An imaginative man might,
not inaptly, conceive himself as a phenomenally gigantic giant
working in some vast petrified graveyard among the petrifactions
of a world infinitely little; and, as the dyer&rsquo;s hand is
subdued to the dye he works in, and&mdash;a less classic
allusion&mdash;as the photographer acquires a permanent stain
from his collodion, he could scarce escape the almost inevitable
mental twist resulting from the surroundings.</p>
<p>And as they were, and in some measure still are, individually
peculiar, so collectively they retain their exclusiveness.&nbsp;
Still, with every recurrent Shrove Tuesday, their guild meets at
Corfe, under the presidency of warden and steward; and even in
these days it is not open for an outsider to become a Purbeck
quarryman.&nbsp; It is an industry only to be followed by
patrimony and by due admission into its membership in the
prescribed manner, which is that of appearing at the annual court
with a penny loaf in one hand, a pot of beer in the other, and a
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>sum of six
shillings and eightpence in the pocket, ready to be duly paid
down.</p>
<p>With all the changes that have overtaken Swanage, who knows
nowadays, save very old folk, that Swanage people are, or were,
locally &ldquo;Swanage Turks&rdquo;?&nbsp; When&mdash;outside
Swanage, of course&mdash;you asked why so named, you were apt to
be told &ldquo;Tarks, we al&rsquo;us carls &rsquo;em, &rsquo;cos
they don&rsquo;t know nawthen about anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
informant in this particular instance was a Poole man.&nbsp; None
could possibly have brought this charge of comprehensive and
thorough-going ignorance against the natives of Poole, for that
ancient port was a sink of iniquity, and inhabited, if we are to
believe the history books&mdash;which there is no reason we
should not do&mdash;by ruffians who were by no means unspotted of
the world, but had plumbed the depths of every wickedness.&nbsp;
Since Swanage has become the terminus of a branch railway and
become a seaside resort, its &ldquo;Turks&rdquo; have acquired a
very considerable amount of worldly wisdom, and can argue and
chop logic with you, as well as the best.</p>
<p>To those who knew and loved old Swanage, the change that has
come with its tardy accessibility by rail is woeful, but to those
who have not so known and loved, I daresay it seems, by contrast
with Bournemouth, a place strangely undeveloped.&nbsp; The
trouble with the first-named is that development has been all too
rapid, and has utterly robbed Swanage of its immemorial character
as the port whence the famous Purbeck stone was shipped.&nbsp;
Alas! pretentious houses of a tall and terrible ugliness now
stand in the middle of the bay, on the shore immediately in front
of what used merely by <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>courtesy to be called &ldquo;the
town,&rdquo; but is now actually grown to that status.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;bankers&rdquo;&mdash;rows upon rows of stacked slabs of
Purbeck stone that used to form so striking a feature of the
shore, and were wont, to a stranger seeing them first on a
moonlit night, to look so grisly, as though this were some
close-packed seashore cemetery&mdash;the circumstance of
facetious irony&mdash;the grown prosperity of Swanage has built
banks, where the Swanage tradesfolk doubtless deposit heavily
from the profits of their summer trading.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In the distance, along the curving shore of Swanage Bay, there
has arisen with the development of the Durlstone estate, a grand
hotel, and in the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>town itself&mdash;the folly of it!&mdash;uninteresting
modern commercial buildings have replaced the quaint old cottages
that, built as they were, in a peculiarly local fashion, with
great stone slabs and rude stone tiling, had their like nowhere
else.&nbsp; Now, the rows of newly arisen streets are such as
have their counterparts in every town, and you can dine
<i>&agrave; la carte</i> or <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> at
the many hotels and boarding-houses, as their announcements
boldly inform the visitor, quite as elaborately as in great
cities.&nbsp; All, without doubt, very refined and up to date,
but perhaps not to all of us, who keep the simple and robustious
appetites of our beginnings, so pleasing a change from the time
(of which Kingsley speaks) when a simple glass of ale and a crust
of bread and cheese at a rustic inn was all one wished, and
certainly all one could have got.</p>
<p>Of those times there are but little &ldquo;islands,&rdquo; so
to speak, left in the surging mass of modern brick and
stone.&nbsp; One of them is the ancient church, whose tower is
thought to be Saxon&mdash;the church where Ethelberta Petherwin,
in <i>The Hand of Ethelberta</i>, marries Lord Mountclere.&nbsp;
Another, tucked away behind the Town Hall, and only to be with
some difficulty discovered, is the old village lock-up.&nbsp; No
dread Bastille this, but an affair resembling a stone tool-house,
twelve feet by eight, and lighted only by the holes in the
decaying woodwork of its nail-studded door.&nbsp; It was built in
1803, &ldquo;erected&rdquo; as the old inscription tells us,
&ldquo;for the prevention of Wickedness and Vice by the Friends
of Religion and Good Order.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inference to be
drawn from the small size of this place of incarceration is that
the &ldquo;Wickedness and Vice&rdquo; of Swanage were <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>on a very
insignificant scale.&nbsp; Although Swanage has grown so greatly,
and now owns a very fine and large police-station, it is not to
be inferred that the delinquencies have increased in proportion,
but rather that officialism has made a larger growth, and that
Swanage, like poor old England in general, is over-governed.</p>
<p>Among other outstanding features of Swanage, conferred upon it
by the late Mr. Mowlem, of the London contracting firm of Mowlem
and Burt, is the Wellington Clock Tower, the Gothic pinnacled
structure now ornamenting the foreshore, in what were once the
private gardens of &ldquo;the Grove.&rdquo;&nbsp; But &ldquo;the
Grove&rdquo; has now, like many another seashore estate, been cut
up, and new villas now take the place of the older
exclusiveness.</p>
<p>The Clock Tower, one of the many memorials to the great Duke
of Wellington, stood, until about 1860, on the south side of
London Bridge, but was removed when the roadway was widened at
that point.&nbsp; Once removed, the good folk of Southwark were
at a loss what to do with it, and so solved their difficulty by
presenting its stones to Mr. Mowlem, the contractor.&nbsp; They
thought he had been saddled with a &ldquo;white elephant,&rdquo;
and chuckled accordingly; but they little knew their man.&nbsp;
He considered the relic &ldquo;just the thing&rdquo; for his
native town of Swanage, and accepting it with the greatest
alacrity, despatched it hither, and presented it to his friend
Mr. Docwra, of &ldquo;the Grove.&rdquo;&nbsp; This poor old
monument to martial glory has suffered of late, for its pinnacle
has been blown down and replaced by a copper sheathing very like
a dish-cover.</p>

92</span>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">SWANAGE TO CORFE
CASTLE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> pilgrim who, whether on foot
or by cycle, shall elect to trace these landmarks, will find the
road out of Swanage to Corfe, by way of Langton Matravers and
Kingston a heart-breaking stretch of stony hills, whose blinding
glare under a summer sun is provocative of ophthalmia, and whose
severities of stone walling, in place of green hedges, recall the
scenery of Ireland.&nbsp; Herston, too, the unlovely outskirt of
Swanage, is not encouraging.&nbsp; But the world&mdash;it is a
truism&mdash;is made up of all sorts, and here, as elsewhere,
rewards come after trials.</p>
<p>Langton Matravers, on the ridge-road, is, just as one might
suppose from the stony nature of Purbeck, a village of stone
houses, and very grim and unornamental ones too.&nbsp; Nine
hundred souls live here, and so long as the &ldquo;Langton
freestone&rdquo; won from its quarries is in good demand, are
happy enough, although subject to every extremity of
weather.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Matravers&rdquo; in the place-name
derives from the old manorial lords, the Maltravers family, who
dropped the &ldquo;l&rdquo; out of their name some time after one
of their race, deeply implicated in the barbarous murder of
Edward II., proved himself a very &ldquo;bad Travers&rdquo;
indeed, and so made his name peculiarly descriptive.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Passing
Gallows Gore Cottages&mdash;what a melodramatic address to
own!&mdash;we come to Kingston village, along just such a road,
with just such a view as that described in <i>The Hand of
Ethelberta</i>, although, to be sure, she went, on that
donkey-ride to Corfe, by another and very roundabout route,
through Ulwell Gap, over Nine Barrow Down.&nbsp; Ordinary folk
would have gone by the ordinary road; but then, you see,
Ethelberta was a poetess, and
&ldquo;unconventionality&mdash;almost eccentricity&mdash;was
<i>de rigueur</i>&rdquo; for such an one.&nbsp; Hence also that
unconventional, and uncomfortable, seat on the donkey&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>From this point Corfe Castle is exquisitely seen, down below
the ridge, but situated on the course of the minor, but still
mighty, backbone that bisects the Isle.&nbsp; From hence, too,
the country may be seen spread out like a map, &ldquo;domains
behind domains, parishes by the score, harbours, fir-woods and
little inland seas mixing curiously together.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dipping down out of sight of all these distant Lands of Promise,
among the richly wooded lanes of Kingston, the glaring limestone
road is exchanged for shaded ways, where sunlight only filters
through in patches of gold, looking to the imaginative as though
some giant had come this way and dropped the contents of his
money-bags.&nbsp; Thatched cottages, tall elms, and old-fashioned
roadside gardens are the features of Kingston; but above all
these, geographically and in every other respect, is the great
and magnificent modern church built for Lord Eldon and completed
in 1880, after seven years&rsquo; work and a vast amount of money
had been expended upon it.&nbsp; It was designed by
Street&mdash;that same &ldquo;obliterator of historic
records&rdquo;&mdash;who at Fawley <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Magna earned Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s
satire; but here were no records to obliterate.&nbsp; Certain
reminiscences of the architect&rsquo;s early studies of the early
Gothic of the Rhine churches may be traced here, in the exterior
design of the apsidal chancel, strongly resembling that of
Fawley, but one would hesitate to apply the opprobrious term of
&ldquo;German-Gothic&rdquo; to this, as a whole.&nbsp; Its
intention is Early English, but the general effect is rather of a
Norman spirit informed with Early English details; an effect
greatly accentuated by the heaviness and bulk of the central
tower, intended by Lord Eldon to be a prominent landmark, and
fulfilling that intention by the sacrifice of proportion to the
rest of the building.&nbsp; Cruciform plan, size, and general
elaboration render this a church particularly unfitted for so
small and so rustic a village.&nbsp; Had its needs been studied,
rather than the ecclesiological tastes of the third Lord Eldon,
the little church built many years ago for the first earl, the
great lawyer-lord, by Repton, would have sufficed; although to be
sure it has all the faults of the first attempts at reviving
Gothic.</p>
<p>The Earl of Eldon purchased the manor of Kingston and the
residence of Encombe from William Morton Pitt in 1807.&nbsp;
Here, in that little church built by him, he lies, beside his
&ldquo;Bessie,&rdquo; that Bessie Surtees with whom he, then
plain and penniless John Scott, eloped from the old house on
Sandhill, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in 1772.&nbsp; His house of Encombe,
the &ldquo;Enkworth Court,&rdquo; of <i>The Hand of
Ethelberta</i>, lies deep down in the glen of Encombe, approached
by a long road gradually descending into the cup-like crater by
the only expedient of <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>winding round it.&nbsp; Think of all
the beautiful road scenery you have ever seen or heard of, and
you will not have seen or been told of anything more beautiful in
its especial kind of beauty than this sequestered road down into
Lord Eldon&rsquo;s retreat.&nbsp; <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Jagged white cliffs here and there
project themselves out of the steep banks of grass and moss above
the way, draped with a profusion of small-leaved ground-ivy and a
wealth of hart&rsquo;s-tongue ferns, and trees romantically shade
the whole.&nbsp; An obelisk erected by the great statesman, on a
bold bluff, to the memory of his brother, Lord Stowell, adds an
element of romance to the scene, and then, plunging into a final
mass of tangled woodland, the grey stone elevation of the house
is seen, ghostlike, fronting a gravel drive, in its silence and
drawn blinds looking less like the home of some fairy princess
than the residence of a misanthrope, who has retired beyond the
reach of the world and drawn his blinds, with the hope of
persuading any who may possibly find their way here that he is
not at home.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Enkworth Court&rdquo; was, we are told, &ldquo;a house
in which Pugin would have torn his hair,&rdquo; and Encombe
certainly can possess no charms for amateurs of Gothic.&nbsp; Nor
can it possibly delight students of the ancient Greek and Roman
orders, for its architecture has classic intentions without being
classical, and heaviness without dignity.&nbsp; But its interior,
if it likewise does not appeal to a cultivated taste in matters
connected with the mother of all the arts, is exceptionally
comfortable.&nbsp; Here the old Chancellor, over eighty years of
age, spent most of his declining days.&nbsp; &ldquo;His sporting
days were over; he had but little interest in gardening or
farming; and his only reading, beside the newspaper, was a
chapter in the Bible.&nbsp; His mornings he spent in an
elbow-chair by the fireside in his study&mdash;called his
shop&mdash;which was ornamented <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>by portraits of his deceased master,
George III. and his living companion, Pincher, a poodle
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Kingston to Corfe Castle, the bourne of innumerable
summer visitors, is two miles.&nbsp; The first glimpse of town
and castle is one which clearly shows how aptly the site of them
obtained its original name of Corvesgate, from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>ceorfan</i>, to cut.&nbsp; The site was so named long before
castle or town were erected here, and referred to the passages
cut or carved through the bold range of hills by the little river
Corfe and its tributaries.&nbsp; Those clefts are clearly
distinguished from here and from the main road between Corfe and
Swanage, and are notched twice, so deeply into the stony range,
that the eminence on which the castle stands is less like a part
of one continuous chain of hills than an isolated conical hill
neighboured by lengthy ridges.</p>
<p>On that islanded hill, shouldered by taller neighbours, the
castle was built, because at this point it so effectually guarded
these passes from the shores of Purbeck to the inland
regions.&nbsp; The position in these days seems a singular one,
for from the upper slopes of those neighbours it is possible to
look down into the castle and observe its every detail, but such
things mattered little in days before artillery.</p>
<p>A first impression of Corfe, if it be summer, is an impression
of dazzling whiteness; resolved, on a nearer approach, into the
pure white of the road and of the occasional repairs and
restorations of the stone-built streets, the grey white of
buildings past their first novelty, and the dead greyness of the
roofing slabs of stone.&nbsp; There is little colour in Corfe
when June has gone.&nbsp; The golden-green <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>lichens and
houseleeks of spring have been sucked dry by the summer heats and
turned to withered rustiness, and even the grass of the
pyramidical hill on which the castle keep is reared has little
more than an exhausted sage-green hue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corvsgate Castle,&rdquo; as we find it styled in <i>The
Hand of Ethelberta</i>, is frequently the scene, at such a time
of year, of meetings like that of the &ldquo;Imperial
Association&rdquo; in that story.&nbsp; All that is to be known
respecting these ruins, &ldquo;the meagre stumps remaining from
flourishing bygone centuries,&rdquo; is the common property of
all interested in historical antiquities, but there is something,
it may be supposed, in revisiting the oft-visited and in
retelling the old tale, which bids defiance to <i>ennui</i> and
precludes satiety, even although the President&rsquo;s address be
a paraphrase of the last arch&aelig;ological paper, and that the
echo of its predecessor, and so forth, in endless
<i>diminuendo</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And smaller fleas have lesser fleas,<br />
And so <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Carfe,&rdquo; as any Wessex man of the soil will name
it, just as horses are &lsquo;harses&rsquo; and hornets become
&lsquo;harnets&rsquo; in his ancient and untutored pronunciation,
is, as already hinted, a place of stone buildings, where brick,
although not unknown, is remarkable.&nbsp; Stone from foundation
to roof, and stone slabs of immense size for the roofs
themselves.&nbsp; In a place where building-stone is and has been
so readily found it is, of course, in the nature of things to
find the remains of a castle that must have been exceptionally
large and strong, and here <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>they are, peering over the rooftops
of the town from whatever point of view you choose.&nbsp; The
castle is as essential a feature in all views of the town as it
is in history; and rightly too, for had it not been for that
fortress there would have been no town.&nbsp; It is a town by
courtesy and ancient estate, and a village by size; a village
that does not grow and has so far escaped the desecration of
modern streets.&nbsp; The market cross, recently restored to
perfection from a shattered stump, and the town hall both declare
it to have been a town, as does, or did, the existence of a
mayor, but such things have long become vanities.&nbsp; The
return of two members to Parliament, a privilege Corfe enjoyed
until reform put an end to it in 1832, proved nothing, for
Parliamentary representation was no more fixed on the principle
of comparative electorates than the representation of Ireland is
now in the House of Commons.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The temperance interest need by no means be shocked when it is
said that the most interesting feature of Corfe, next to the
castle, is its inn.&nbsp; The church does not count; for the body
of it has been uninterestingly rebuilt, and only the fine tower,
of Perpendicular date, remains.&nbsp; The inns, however, combine
picturesqueness with the solid British comforts of old times and
the less substantial amenities of the new.&nbsp; Here, looking
upon the &ldquo;Bankes Arms,&rdquo; with its highly elaborate
heraldic sign, you can have no manner of doubt as to what family
is still paramount in Corfe, and I think, perhaps, that to
shelter behind so gorgeous an achievement even reflects a halo
upon the guest; while if the &ldquo;Greyhound&rdquo; can confer
no such satisfaction, its unusual picturesqueness, <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>with that
charming feature of a porch projecting over the pavement and
owning a capacious room poised above the comings and goings, the
commerce and gossipings of the people, can at least give a
visitor the charm of what, although an ancient feature of the
place, is at least a novelty to him.</p>
<p>The three cylindrical stone columns of plethoric figure which
support this porch and its room are more generally useful than
the architect who placed them here, some two hundred and eighty
years ago, probably ever imagined they would be.&nbsp; <i>He</i>
devised them for the support of his gazebo above, but more than
twenty generations of Wessex folk have found them convenient for
leaning-stocks, and the comfortable support they give has further
lengthened many a long argument which, had all contributing
parties stood supported only by their own two natural posts that
carry the bodily superstructure, would have been earlier
concluded.&nbsp; The progress of an argument, discussion,
narration, or negotiation under such unequal conditions is to be
watched with interest.&nbsp; Time probably will forbid one being
followed from beginning to end; but to be a spectator of one of
these comedies from the middle onwards is sufficient.&nbsp; The
length it has already been played may generally be pretty
accurately estimated by the state of weariness or impatience
exhibited by that party to it who is not supported by the
pillar.&nbsp; The &ldquo;well, as I was saying&rdquo; of the one
enjoying the leaning-stock, discloses, like the parson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;secondly, Dear brethren,&rdquo; the fact that the
discourse is well on the way, but the same thing may be gathered
by those out <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>of earshot, in the man&oelig;uvres of the less
fortunate of the two, the one who is supporting his own
bulk.&nbsp; He stands upright, hands behind his back, while
swaying his walking stick; then he leans his weight to one side
upon it, first (if he be a stout man, whom it behoves to exercise
caution) carefully selecting a safe crevice in the jointing of
the pavement, as a bearing for the ferule of his ash-plant; then,
growing weary of this attitude, he repeats the process on the
other side, changing after a while to the expedient of a sideways
stress, halfway up the body, by straining the walking stick
horizontally against the wall.&nbsp; Then, having exhausted all
possible movements, he takes a bulky silver watch from his
pocket, and affects to find time unexpectedly ahead of him; and
when this resort is reached the spectacle generally comes to a
conclusion.</p>
<p>But it is time to follow Ethelberta into the
castle:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ethelberta crossed the bridge over the
moat, and rode under the first archway into the outer ward.&nbsp;
As she had expected, not a soul was here.&nbsp; The arrow-slits,
portcullis-grooves, and staircases met her eye as familiar
friends, for in her childhood she had once paid a visit to the
spot.&nbsp; Ascending the green incline and through another arch
into the second ward, she still pressed on, till at last the ass
was unable to clamber an inch further.&nbsp; Here she dismounted,
and tying him to a stone which projected like a fang from a raw
edge of wall, performed the remainder of the journey on
foot.&nbsp; Once among the towers above, she became so interested
in the windy corridors, mildewed dungeons, and the tribe <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>of daws
peering invidiously upon her from overhead, that she forgot the
flight of time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ruins that Ethelberta and the &ldquo;Imperial
Association&rdquo; had come to inspect owe their heaped and
toppling ruination to that last great armed convulsion in our
insular history, the Civil War, whose two greatest personalities
were Charles I. and Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; Until that time the
proud fortress had stood unharmed, as stalwart as when built in
Norman times.</p>
<p>The history of Corfe before those times is very obscure, and
no one has yet discovered whether the first recorded incident in
it took place at a mere hunting-lodge here or at the gates of a
fortress.&nbsp; That incident, the first and most atrocious of
all the atrocious deeds of blood wrought at Corfe, was the murder
of King Edward &ldquo;the Martyr,&rdquo; in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 978, by his stepmother, Queen
Elfrida, anxious to secure the throne for her own son.&nbsp; The
boy&mdash;he was only in his nineteenth year&mdash;had drawn rein
here, on his return alone from hunting, and was drinking at the
door from a goblet handed him by Elfrida herself when she stabbed
him to the heart.&nbsp; His horse, startled at the attack, darted
away, dragging the body by the stirrups, and thus, battered and
lifeless, it was found.</p>
<p>Built, or rebuilt, in the time of the Conqueror, Corfe Castle
was early besieged, and in that passage gave a good account of
itself and justified its existence, for King Stephen failed to
take it by force or to starve the garrison out.&nbsp; How long he
may have been pleased to sit down before it we do not know, for
the approach of a relieving force <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>caused him to pack his baggage and
be off.&nbsp; Strong, however, as it was even then, it was
continually under enlargement in the reigns of Henry II., Henry
III., and Edward I., and had a better right to the oft-used boast
of being impregnable than most other fortresses.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">CORFE CASTLE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> some cruel ogre of folk-lore
the Castle of Corfe has drunk deep of blood.&nbsp; Its strength
kept prisoners safely guarded, as well as foes at arm&rsquo;s
length, and many a despairing wretch has been hurried through the
now ruined gatehouse, to the muttered &ldquo;God help him!&rdquo;
of some compassionate warder.&nbsp; Through the great open Outer
Ward and steeply uphill between the two gloomy circular
drum-towers across the second ward, and thence to the Dungeon
Tower at the further left-hand corner of the stronghold, they
were taken and thrust into some vile place of little ease, to be
imprisoned for a lifetime, to be starved to death, or more
mercifully ended by the assassin&rsquo;s dagger.&nbsp;
Twenty-four knights captured in Brittany, in arms against King
John, in aid of his nephew, Arthur, were imprisoned here, in
1202, and twenty-two of them met death by starvation in some foul
underground hold.&nbsp; Prince Arthur, as every one knows, was
blinded by orders of the ruthless king, and Arthur&rsquo;s
sister, Eleanor, was thrown into captivity, first here and then
at Bristol, where, after forty years, she died.&nbsp; Thus did
monarchs dispose of rivals, and those who aided them, in the
&ldquo;good old days,&rdquo; and other monarchs, <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>not so
ferocious, or not so well able to take care of themselves, stood
in danger of tasting the same fare, as in the case of Edward II.
imprisoned here and murdered in the dungeons of Berkeley
Castle.&nbsp; Sympathies go out to the unhappy captives and
victims, but a knowledge of these things tells us that they would
have done the same, had opportunity offered and the positions
been reversed.</p>
<p>This stronghold held many a humbler prisoner, among them those
who had offended in one or other of the easy ways of offence in
this, the King&rsquo;s deer-forest of Purbeck; and many others
immured for mere caprice.&nbsp; The place must have reeked with
blood and been strewn with bones like a hy&aelig;na&rsquo;s
lair.</p>

<p>So much for the domestic history of Corfe Castle.&nbsp; Its
last great appearance in the history of the nation was during the
civil wars of King and Parliament, when it justified the design
of its builders, and proved the excellence of its defences by
successfully withstanding two sieges; falling in the second
solely by treachery.&nbsp; It had by that time passed through
many hands, and had come at last to the Bankes family, by whom it
is still owned.&nbsp; It was only eight years before the first
siege in this war that the property had been acquired by the Lord
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Sir John Bankes, who purchased
it from the widow of that celebrated lawyer, Sir Edward Coke, the

</a></p>
<p>When the civil war broke out, Sir John Bankes, called to the
King&rsquo;s side at York, left his wife and children at their
home of Kingston Lacy, near Wimborne Minster, whence, for
security from the <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>covert sneers and petty annoyances offered them by the
once humbly subservient townsfolk, not slow to note the trend of
affairs, they removed in the autumn of 1642 to Corfe Castle,
where they spent the winter unmolested.</p>
<p>Although they thus sought shelter here, they probably had no
idea of the heights to which the tide of rebellion would rise,
and could scarce have anticipated being besieged; but the
Parliamentary leaders in the district had their eyes upon a
fortress which, already obsolete and the subject of antiquarian
curiosity, could yet be made a place of strength, as the sequel
was presently to show.</p>
<p>The first attempt to gain possession of the castle was by a
subterfuge, ingenious and plausible enough.&nbsp; The Mayor of
Corfe had from time immemorial held a stag hunt annually, on May
Day, and it was thought that, if on this occasion some additional
parties of horse were to attend, and to seize the stronghold
under colour of paying a visit, the thing would be done with
ease.&nbsp; So probably it would, but for the keen feminine
intuition of Lady Bankes, who closed the gates and mounted a
guard upon the entrance-towers, so that when those huntsmen came
and demanded surrender, scarcely in the manner of visitors, they
were at once denied admission, and effectually unmasked.&nbsp;
The revolutionary committee sitting at Poole then considered it
advisable to despatch a body of sailors, who appeared before the
castle, early one morning, to demand the surrender of four small
dismounted pieces of cannon with which it was armed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says the <i>Mercurius Rusticus</i>, a
contemporary news-sheet, &ldquo;instead of delivering them,
though at the time there were but <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>five men in the Castle, yet these
five, assisted by the maid-servants, at their ladies&rsquo;
Command, mount these peeces on their carriages againe, and lading
one of them they gave fire, which small Thunder so affrighted the
Sea-men that they all quitted the place and ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Operations thus opened, Lady Bankes proved herself a ready and
resourceful general.&nbsp; By beat of drum she summoned tenants
and friends, who, responding to the number of fifty, garrisoned
the fortress for about a week, when a scarcity of provisions,
together with threatening letters, and the entreaties of their
wives, to whom home and children were more than King or
Parliament, or the Bankes family either, made them shamble home
again.&nbsp; We should perhaps not be too ready to censure
them.&nbsp; Lady Bankes, however, did not despair.&nbsp; A born
strategist, she perceived how vitally necessary it was, above all
else, to lay in a stock of provisions; and to secure them, and
time for her preparations she offered in the meekest way to give
up those cannon which, after all, although they made the maximum
of noise effected a minimum of harm.</p>
<p>The enemy, pacified by this offer, removed the guns and left
the castle alone for a while; thinking its defences weak
enough.&nbsp; But it was soon thoroughly provisioned, supplied
with ammunition, and garrisoned under the command of one Captain
Lawrence, and when the Roundheads of Poole next turned their
attention to Corfe, behold! it was bristling like a porcupine
with pikes and musquetoons and all those ancient
seventeenth-century engines of war, with which men were quaintly
done to <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>death&mdash;when by some exceptional chance the
marksmen earned their name and hit anybody.</p>
<p>The middle of June had gone before the Parliamentary forces
from Poole made their appearance.&nbsp; They numbered between two
and three hundred horse and foot, and brought two cannon, with
which they played upon the castle from the neighbouring hills,
with little effect.&nbsp; Then came an interlude, ended by the
appearance, on June 23rd, of Sir Walter Erle with between five
and six hundred men, to reinforce the besiegers.&nbsp; They
brought with them a &ldquo;Demy-Canon, a Culverin, and two
Sacres,&rdquo; and with these fired a hail of small shot down
into the castle upon those heights on either hand.&nbsp; The
results were poor to insignificance, and it was then determined
to attempt a storming of the castle.&nbsp; This grand advance,
made on June 26th, was begun by intimidating shouts that no
quarter would be granted, but the garrison were so little
terrified by this fighting with the mouth that, tired of waiting
the enemy from the walls, they even sallied out and slaughtered
some of the foremost, who were approaching cautiously under cover
of strange engines named the &ldquo;Sow&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Boar.&rdquo;&nbsp; The besiegers then mounted a cannon on
the top of the church-tower, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; we are told,
&ldquo;they, without fears of prophanation used,&rdquo; and
breaking the organ, used the pipes of it for shot-cases.&nbsp;
The ammunition included, among other strange missiles, lumps of
lead torn off the roof and rolled up.</p>
<p>All these things proving useless, a band of a hundred and
fifty sailors was sent by the Earl of Warwick, with large
supplies of petards and <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>grenadoes, and a number of scaling
ladders, and then all thought the enterprise in a fair way of
being ended.&nbsp; The sailors, nothing loth, were made drunk,
the ladders were placed against the walls, and a sum of twenty
pounds was offered to the first man up.&nbsp; With preparations
so generous as these a riotous scaling-party, carrying pikes and
hand-grenades, strove to mount the ladders, but were met by an
avalanche of hot cinders, stones, and things still more
objectionable, hoarded up by the garrison from those primitive
sanitary contrivances called by antiquaries
&ldquo;garderobes,&rdquo; against such a contingency as
this.&nbsp; One sailor has his clothes almost burnt off his back,
another&rsquo;s courage is dowsed with a pail of slops, others
are knocked over, bruised and battered, into the dry moat, by a
hundredweight of stone heaved over the battlements, and long
ladders full of escaladers, swarming up, on one another&rsquo;s
heels, are flung backward with tremendous crashes by prokers from
arrow-slits in the bastioned walls.&nbsp; Soldiers under the
machicolated entrance towers have had their steel morions crushed
down upon their heads by heavy weights dropped upon them, and are
left gasping for breath and slowly suffocating in that meat-tin
kind of imprisonment; and a more than ordinarily active besieger,
who has made himself exceptionally prominent, is suddenly
flattened out by a heavy lump of lead.&nbsp; &ldquo;The knocks
are too hot,&rdquo; as Shakespeare says, and the assailants are
forced to retire, to bury their dead, to tend one another&rsquo;s
hurts, and those most fortunate to cleanse themselves.&nbsp; That
same night of August 4th, Sir Walter Erle, hearing a rumour of
the King&rsquo;s forces approaching, hurriedly raised <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>the siege
and retreated upon Poole, and not until February 1646 was Corfe
Castle again molested.</p>
<p>This time it was beset to more purpose.&nbsp; Lady Bankes, now
a widow, for her husband had died in 1644, parted from his
family, was at Corfe, vigilant, keen-eyed, loyal, and more or
less strictly blockaded between Roundhead garrisons.&nbsp;
Wareham was in their possession, Poole, as ever, a hotbed of
disaffection, and Swanage watched by land and sea.&nbsp; A
gallant deed performed at the opening of 1646 by one Cromwell, a
youthful officer strangely enough, considering his name, on the
Royalist side, was of no avail.&nbsp; He with his troops burst
through the enemy&rsquo;s lines at Wareham and on the way
encountered the Parliamentary governor of that place, whom he
captured and brought to Corfe.&nbsp; This was undertaken to
afford Lady Bankes an opportunity of escaping, if she wished, but
she fortunately refused, for on the way back the little party
were captured.</p>
<p>The castle was then besieged by Colonel Bingham, and endured
for forty-eight days the rigours of a strict investment.&nbsp; In
the meanwhile, Lawrence, the governor, deserted and at the same
time released the imprisoned governor of Wareham.&nbsp; Every one
knew the King&rsquo;s cause here and in the whole of the kingdom
to be in desperate straits, and the knowledge of fighting for a
losing side unnerved all.&nbsp; Seeing the inevitable course of
events, Lieutenant-Colonel Pitman, one of the defenders&rsquo;
officers, secretly opened negotiations with the enemy for the
surrender, and, succeeding in persuading the new governor, who
had taken the post deserted by Lawrence, that a reinforcement
from Somersetshire <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>was expected, under that guise at dead of night
admitted fifty Parliamentary troops into the keep.&nbsp; When
morning dawned the garrison found themselves betrayed; but,
commanding as they did the lives of some thirty prisoners, they
were able to exact favourable terms of surrender.&nbsp; And then,
when all the defenders marched out, kegs of gunpowder were laid
in keep and curtain-towers, down in dungeons and under roofs, and
the match applied.&nbsp; When the roar and smoke of the explosion
had died away, the stern walls that for five hundred years had
frowned down upon the streets of Corfe had gone up in ruin.</p>
<p>Not altogether destroyed, in the Biblical completeness of the
fulfilled prophecies of &ldquo;not one stone upon another,&rdquo;
concerning Nineveh, and the Cities of the Plain; for tall spires
of cliff-like masonry still represent the keep and gateway, and
curtain-towers remain in recognisable shapes, connected by riven
jaws of masonry, so hard and so formless that they are not easily
to be distinguished from the rock in which their foundations are
set.&nbsp; Here a tower may be seen, lifted up bodily by the
agency of gunpowder, and set down again at a distance, gently and
as fairly plumb as it was it its original position: there another
has been torn asunder, as one tears a sheet of paper, and a few
steps away is another, leaning at a much more acute angle than
the Leaning Tower of Pisa.&nbsp; Everywhere, light is let into
dungeons and battlements abased; floors abolished and great empty
stone fireplaces on what were second, third and fourth floors
turned to mouthpieces for the winds.&nbsp; And yet, although such
havoc has been wrought, and although it is almost <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>impossible
to identify the greater part of its chambers, Corfe Castle is
still a fine and an impressive ruin.&nbsp; It is grand when seen
from afar, and not less grand when viewed near at hand, from the
ravine in which runs the road to Wareham.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WAREHAM</p>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> is a straight and easy road
which in four miles leads from Corfe to Wareham, and a breezy and
bracing road too, across heaths quite as unspoilt as those of
&ldquo;Egdon,&rdquo; but of a more cheerful and hopeful
aspect.&nbsp; <i>The Return of the Native</i>, whose scene is
laid on the heaths to the north-west, could not, with the same
justness of description, have been staged upon these, and from
another circumstance, quite apart from this heart-lifting
breeziness, these heaths have little in common with their
brooding neighbours.&nbsp; They are enlivened with the signs of a
very ancient and long-continued industry, for where the Romans
discovered and dug in the great deposits of china-clay found here
the Dorsetshire labourer still digs, and runs his truckloads on
crazy tramways down to the quays upon Poole Harbour at
Goathorn.&nbsp; Fragments of Roman pottery, made from this clay,
are still occasionally found here, but since that time the clay
has not been turned to extensive use on the spot where it is
found, but is shipped for Staffordshire and abroad.&nbsp; Much of
Poole&rsquo;s prosperity is due to the china-clay trade, carried
on by the vessels of that <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>port, which receive it from barges
crossing the harbour.&nbsp; It was early used for tobacco-pipes,
and probably those of Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s first
experiments were made from the clay found here.&nbsp; So far back
as 1760 the export of Purbeck china-clay had reached ten thousand
tons annually.&nbsp; It has now risen to about sixty
thousand.</p>
<p>This northern portion of the Isle of Purbeck is indeed of
altogether different character from the rugged stony southern
half, beyond Corfe.&nbsp; It is low-lying and heathy, and the
roads are a complete change from the blinding whiteness
characterising those of Purbeck <i>Petr&aelig;a</i>, as it may be
named.&nbsp; Here, mended with ironstone, they are of a ruddy
colour.</p>
<p>Leaving the clay-cutters and their terraced diggings behind,
we come, past the paltry hamlet of Stoborough, within sight of
Wareham, entered across a long causeway over the Frome marshes
and over an ancient Gothic bridge spanning the Frome
itself.&nbsp; Ahead is seen the tower of St. Mary&rsquo;s, one of
the only two churches remaining of the original eight.&nbsp; Five
of the others have been swept away, and the sixth is converted
into a school.&nbsp; Wareham, it will be guessed, is not a
mushroom place of yesterday, but has a past and has seen many
changes.</p>
<p>Wareham, &ldquo;the oldest arnshuntest place in Do&rsquo;set,
where ye turn up housen underneath yer &rsquo;tater-patch,&rdquo;
as described to the present historian by a rustic, who might have
been the original of Haymoss, in <i>Two on a Tower</i>, is indeed
of a hoary antiquity, and bears many evidences of that attractive
fact.&nbsp; Its chief streets, named after the cardinal points of
the compass, do not perhaps afford the best <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>evidences
of that age, for they are broad and straight and lined with
houses which, if not all Georgian, are so largely in that style
that they influence the general character of the thoroughfares
and give them an air of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; For this
there is an excellent reason, found in the almost complete
destruction by fire of Wareham, on July 25th, 1762.</p>
<p>To the ordinary traveller&mdash;and certainly to the
commercial traveller&mdash;without a bias for history and
antiquities, it is the dullest town in Wessex.&nbsp; Not decayed,
like Cerne Abbas, its streets are yet void and still, and how it,
under this constant solitude and somnolence, manages to retain
its prosperity and cheerfulness is an unsolved riddle.</p>
<p>Wareham, like Dorchester, was enclosed within earthworks; but
while Dorchester has overleaped those ancient bounds, Wareham has
shrunk within them, and one who, climbing those stupendous
fortifications, looks down upon the little town, sees gardens and
orchards, pigsties and cowsheds plentifully intermingled with the
streets, on the spot where other and vanished streets once
stood.&nbsp; That &ldquo;once,&rdquo; however, was so long ago
that the effect of decay, once produced, no longer obtains, and
the mind dwells, not so greatly upon the fallen fortunes evident
in such things, as upon the luxuriance of the gardens themselves
and the prettiness of the picture they produce, intermingled with
the houses.</p>
<p>Wareham&mdash;&ldquo;Anglebury&rdquo; Mr. Hardy calls
it&mdash;is, or was when the latest census returns were
published, a town of two thousand and three inhabitants.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Since then it has certainly not increased, and most likely has
lost more than those odd three, thus coming within the fatal
definition given somewhere, by some one, of a village.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Things are in this way come to a parlous state, for
this is the latest of a good many modern strokes.&nbsp; One,
which hurt its pride not a little, was when, in the
redistribution of Parliamentary seats, it lost its representation
and became merged in a county division.&nbsp; Another&mdash;but
why enumerate these undeserved whips and scorns?&nbsp; In one
respect Wareham keeps an urban character.&nbsp; It has two
inns&mdash;the &ldquo;Black Bear&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Red
Lion&rdquo;&mdash;that call themselves hotels, and a score or so
of minor houses where, if you cannot obtain a desirable
&ldquo;cup of genuine,&rdquo; why, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a sad thing
and an oncivilised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was doubtless its ancient story which induced Mr. Hardy to
style Wareham &ldquo;Anglebury,&rdquo; for that story is greatly
concerned with the settlement of the Anglo-Saxons in Dorset and
the fortunes of the Kingdom of Wessex.&nbsp; Conveniently near
the sea, within the innermost recesses of Poole Harbour, and yet
removed from the rage and havoc of the outer elements, it lies on
the half-mile-broad tongue of land separating the two rivers
Piddle and Frome, at the distance of little over a mile from
where they debouch upon the landlocked harbour.&nbsp; In a nook
such as this you might think a town would have been secure, and
that was the hope of those who founded it here.&nbsp; But, to
render assurance doubly sure, those original
town-builders&mdash;who were probably much earlier than the
invading Saxons and are thought to have been some British
tribe&mdash;heaped up and dug out those famous &ldquo;walls of
Wareham,&rdquo; which surround the town to this day, and are not
walls in the common acceptation of <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the term, but ditches so deeply
delved, and mounds so steeply piled that they are in some places
little more scalable than a forthright, plumb up and down, wall
of brick or masonry would be, and with an &ldquo;angle of
repose&rdquo; sufficiently acute to astonish any modern railway
engineer.</p>
<p>Wareham, lying within these cyclopean earthworks, was a place
of strength, but it was its very strength that brought about the
bloody tangle of its long history.&nbsp; Strong defences require
determined attacks.&nbsp; That history only opens with some
clearness at the time of the Saxon occupation, when the piratical
Danes were beginning to harry the coast, but it continues with
accounts of fierce assaults and merciless forays, repeated until
the time when Guthrum, the Danish chief, was opposed by only a
few dispirited defenders.&nbsp; In <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 876 these Northmen captured the
place, but were besieged by Alfred the Great, who starved them
out.&nbsp; Some Saxon confidence then returned, but the old
miseries were repeated when Canute, not yet the pious Canute of
his last years, sailed up the Frome and not only destroyed this
already oft-destroyed town, but pillaged the greater part of
Wessex.</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that Wareham was described as a desolated
place when the Conqueror came; but it was made to hold up its
head once more, and the two mints it had owned in the time of
Saxon Athelstan were re-established.&nbsp; The castle, whose name
alone survives, in that of Castle Hill, was then built, and, in
the added strength it gave, was the source of many troubles soon
to come.&nbsp; It was surprised and seized for the Empress Maud
in 1138, but captured and burnt by Stephen four years <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>later, in
the absence of its governor, the Earl of Gloucester, who
returning, recaptured the town after a three-weeks&rsquo;
siege.&nbsp; At length the treaty of peace and tolerance between
Stephen and Maud gave the townsfolk&mdash;those few of them who
had been courageous enough to remain, and fortunate enough to
survive&mdash;an opportunity of creeping out of the cellars, and
of looking around and reviewing their position.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope
springs eternal,&rdquo; and these remnants of the Wareham folk
were in some measure justified of their faith, for it was not
until another half-century had passed that the town was again
besieged and taken.&nbsp; That event was an <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>incident in
the contention between King John and his Barons, and a feature of
it was the destruction of the castle, never afterwards
rebuilt.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>That destruction was one of the greatest blessings that could
possibly have befallen this ancient cockpit of racial and
personal warfares, for it rendered Wareham a place of little
account in the calculations of medi&aelig;val partisans; and then
it grew and prospered, unmolested, until the Civil War of Crown
and Parliament, when old times came again, in the bewildering
circumstances of its being garrisoned for the Parliament against
the inclination of the loyal townsfolk, besieged and half ruined
and then captured by the Royalists, obliged to batter the
property of their friends before they could recover it, and then
stormed and surrendered and regained and evacuated until the Muse
of History herself ceases to keep tally.&nbsp; Few people looked
on: most took an active part, and the rector himself, &ldquo;a
stiff-necked and stubborn scorner of good things,&rdquo; was
wounded in the head and imprisoned nineteen times.&nbsp; The
obvious criticism here is that they must have been short
sentences.&nbsp; The Parliamentary commander, Sir Anthony Ashley
Cooper, was for punishing the &ldquo;dreadful malignancy shown
towards the cause of righteousness&rdquo; by the Wareham people,
and advised that the place be &ldquo;plucked down and made no
town&rdquo;; but this course was not adopted.</p>
<p>Apart from battles and sieges, Wareham has witnessed many
horrid deeds.&nbsp; In that castle whose site alone remains,
Robert de Belesme was starved to death in 1114, and on those
walls an unfortunate and indiscreet hermit and prophet, one Peter
of <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>Pomfret, who had prophesied that the King should lose
his crown, was hanged and quartered in 1213, after having been
fed, in the manner of the prophet Micaiah, with the bread of
affliction, and the water of affliction, in the gruesome dungeons
of Corfe.&nbsp; For King John, the Ahab of our history, had a way
of his own with seers of visions and prophesiers of disaster; and
his way, it will be allowed, very effectually discouraged prying
into futurity.</p>
<p>Here also, at a corner of these grassy ramparts still called
&ldquo;Bloody Bank,&rdquo; three poor fellows who had taken part
in the Monmouth Rebellion were hanged, portions of their bodies
being afterwards exposed, with ghastly barbarity, in different
parts of the town.</p>
<p>Following the long broad street from where the town is entered
across the Frome, the &ldquo;Black Bear&rdquo; is passed,
prominent with its porch and the great chained effigy of the
black bear himself, sitting on his rump upon the roof of
it.&nbsp; Passing the Church of St. Martin, perched boldly on a
terrace above the road, its tower bearing a quaintly lettered
tablet, handing the churchwardens of 1712 down to posterity, we
now come to the northern extremity of Wareham, and descending to
the banks of the Piddle, may, looking backwards, see those old
defences, the so-styled &ldquo;walls,&rdquo; heaped up with
magnificent emphasis.</p>
<p>They envisage the ancient drama of the contested town, and
although it is a drama long since played, and the curtain rung
down upon the last act, two hundred and fifty years ago, this
scenery of it can still eloquently recall its dragonadoes and
blood-boltered episodes.</p>

the sign of the public where John Durbeyfield boozed, at far-away
Marlott, a valley road leads by East Stoke to the remains of
Bindon Abbey.</p>
<p>The ruins of Bindon Abbey are few and formless, standing in
tree-grown and unkempt grounds, where a black and green stagnant
moat surrounds a curious circular mound.&nbsp; Those who
demolished Bindon Abbey did their work thoroughly, for little is
left of it save the bases of columns and the foundations of
walls, in which arch&aelig;ological societies see darkly the
ground plan of the old Cistercian monastery.&nbsp; A few stone

</a>Here that thing not greatly in accord with monastic remains
and hallowed vestiges of the olden times&mdash;a railway
station&mdash;comes within sight and hearing at the end of Wool
village.&nbsp; Old and new, quiet repose and the bustling conduct
of business, mingle strangely here, for within sight of Wool
railway station, and within hearing of the clashing of the heavy
consignments of milk-churns, driven up to it, to be placed on the
rail and sent to qualify the tea of London&rsquo;s great
populations, stands the great, mellowed, Elizabethan, red brick
grange or mansion known as Woolbridge House, romantically placed
on the borders of the rushy river Frome.&nbsp; The property at
one time belonged to the neighbouring Abbey of Bindon, from which
it came to Sir Thomas Poynings, and then to John
Turberville.&nbsp; Garrisoned as a strategic point during the
Civil Wars, its history since that period is an obscure and
stagnant one.&nbsp; Long since passed from Turberville hands, it
now belongs to the Erle-Drax family of Charborough Park and
Holnest.&nbsp; The air of bodeful tragedy that naturally enwraps
the place and has <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>made many a passenger in the passing trains exclaim at
sight of it, &ldquo;what a fitting home for a story!&rdquo; has
at last been justified in its selection by the novelist as the
scene of Tess&rsquo;s confession to her husband.&nbsp; It was
here the newly married pair were to have spent their
honeymoon.&nbsp; &ldquo;They drove by the level road along the
valley, to a distance of a few miles, and, reaching Wellbridge,
turned away from the village to the left, and over the great
Elizabethan bridge, which gives the place half its name.&nbsp;
Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had engaged
lodgings, whose external features are so well known to all
travellers through the Frome Valley; once portion of a fine
manorial residence, and the property and seat of a
D&rsquo;Urberville, but since its partial demolition, a
farm-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not altogether remarkable that Clare found the
&ldquo;mouldy old habitation&rdquo; somewhat depressing to his
dear one; and she was altogether startled and frightened at
&ldquo;those horrid women,&rdquo; whose portraits are actually,
as in the pages of the novel they are said to be, on the walls of
the staircase: &ldquo;two life-size portraits on panels built
into the masonry.&nbsp; As all visitors are aware, these
paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two
hundred years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be
forgotten.&nbsp; The long pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk
of the one, so suggestive of merciless treachery; the bill-hook
nose, large teeth, and bold eye of the other, suggesting
arrogance to the point of ferocity, haunt the beholder afterwards
in his dreams.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are indeed unprepossessing
dames.&nbsp; One is growing indistinguishable, but the other
still wickedly leers <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>at you, glancing from the tail of
her eye, as though challenging admiration.&nbsp; A painted round
or oval decorative frame surrounds these Turberville portraits,
for such they are, and so they were explained to be to Clare, who
uneasily recognised their likeness in an exaggerated form, to his
own darling.&nbsp; All the old D&rsquo;Urberville vices of
lawless cunning, medi&aelig;val ferocity, and callous
heartlessness are reflected in those sinister portraits, which
seemed to him to hold up a distorting mirror to the woman he had
married, and certainly proved themselves of her kin.</p>

<p>A farm-house the place remains, the ground-floor rooms
stone-flagged and chilly to modern notions, the fireplaces vast
and cavernous as they are wont to be in such old houses.&nbsp; It
is perhaps more romantic seen in the middle distance than when
made the subject of closer study.&nbsp; But it is of course the
home of a ghost story, and a very fine and aristocratic
ghost-story too, made the subject of an allusion in <i>Tess of
the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>.&nbsp; It seems that in that very
long ago, generally referred to in fairy stories as &ldquo;once
upon a time,&rdquo; there was a Turberville whose unholy passions
so broke all bounds of restraint that he murdered a guest while
the two of them were riding in the Turberville family
coach.&nbsp; But as the guest was himself one of the family, it
were a more judicial thing, perhaps, to divide the blame.&nbsp;
This incident in the annals of a race who very improperly often
figured as sheriffs and such-like guardians of law and order,
took place on the road between Wool and Bere, and we are asked to
believe that there are those who have heard the wheels of the
blood-stained family <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>coach traversing this route.&nbsp;
One or two are said to have seen it, but <i>they</i> are persons
proved to own some mixture of that blood, for to none other is
this pleasing spectacle of a black midnight coach and demon
horses vouchsafed.&nbsp; But stay!&nbsp; Not so pleasing after
all, this proof of ancestry, for to them it is a warning of
impending disaster and dissolution.</p>

<p>That is a terribly dusty road which, in six miles, leads from
Woolbridge to Bere Regis, across the heaths: in some
summers&mdash;<i>experto crede</i>&mdash;so astonishingly deep in
dust that it is not only impossible to ride a bicycle over it,
but scarce possible to walk.&nbsp; But this heath road is as
variable as the moods of a woman.&nbsp; It will be of this
complexion at one time, and at another entirely different.&nbsp;
It is perhaps only when this desirable difference rules that one
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>appreciates the scenery it passes through; scenery
wholly of buff sand, purple heather, furze, and bracken, whose
colours are by distance blended into that rich purple brown
termed, in <i>The Return of the Native</i>,
&ldquo;swart.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this is the district of that
gloomy tale, perhaps at once the most powerful and painful in its
tragic intensity of all the Wessex novels, and one in which the
element of scenery adds most strikingly to the unfolding of
futilities and disasters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bere Heath&rdquo; it is,
according to the chartographers of the Ordnance Survey, but to
ourselves who are on literary pilgrimage bent, it is Egdon Heath
whose &ldquo;swart abrupt slopes&rdquo; are here seen on every
side, now rising into natural hillocks masquerading solemnly as
sepulchral tumuli, now dipping into hollows where the rainwater
collects in marshy pools and keeps green the croziers and
fully-opened fronds of the bracken much longer than the parched
growths, at the crests of these rises; and again spreading out
into little scrubby plains.</p>
<p>Mr. Hardy, who has translated the reticent solemnity of Egdon
Heath into such poignant romance, has said how pleasant it is to
think or dream that some spot in these extensive wilds may be the
heath of Lear, that traditionary King of Wessex whose sorrows
Shakespeare has made the subject of tragedy; and he has himself,
in <i>The Return of the Native</i>, made these heaths the stage
whereon a tragedy is enacted that itself bids fair to become a
classic little less classical than the works of
Shakespeare.&nbsp; True it is that his tragedy is in the rustic
kind, and none of the characters in it far above the homespun
sort, but the stricken <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>worm feels as great a pang as when a
giant dies, and the woes of Mrs. Yeobright, of Clym, and of
Eustacia and Damon Wildeve are none the less thrilling than those
of that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . very foolish fond old man<br />
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more or less,&rdquo;</p>

<p>whose wanderings are the theme of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
muse.</p>

<p><i>The Return of the Native</i> is a story of days as well as
nights, of fair weather and foul, of sunshine and darkness, but
it is in essence the story of a darkened stage.&nbsp; The
description of Egdon in the opening chapter is the keynote of a
mournful fugue:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The face of the heath by its mere
complexion added half an hour to evening: it could in like manner
retard the dawn, sadden noon, anticipate the frowning of storms
scarcely generated, and intensify the opacity of a moonless
midnight to a cause of shaking and dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, precisely at this transitional point of its
nightly roll into darkness the great and particular glory of the
Egdon waste began, and nobody could be said to understand the
heath who had not been there at such a time.&nbsp; It could best
be felt when it could not clearly be seen, its complete effect
and explanation lying in this and the succeeding hours before the
next dawn: then, and only then, did it tell its true tale.&nbsp;
The spot was, indeed, a near relation of night, and when night
showed itself an apparent tendency to gravitate together could be
perceived in its shades and the scene.&nbsp; The sombre stretch
of rounds and hollows seemed to rise and <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>meet the
evening gloom in pure sympathy, the heath exhaling darkness as
rapidly as the heavens precipitated it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An artist who should come to Egdon, intent upon studying its
colour-scheme, would be nonplussed by the more than usual
fickleness and instability of its daylight hues.&nbsp; Shrouded
in the black repose of night, its tone is a thing of some
permanence, but under the effects of sunshine he finds it now
purple, now raw sienna, shading off into Prout&rsquo;s Brown, and
again rising to glints and fleeting stripes of rich golden
yellow.&nbsp; It would be the despair of one who worked in the
slow analytic manner of a Birket Foster, but the joy of an
impressionist like a Whistler.</p>

<p>The extremely rich and beautiful colouring of Wool and Bere
Heaths deepens with the setting of the sun to a velvety blackness
and gives to the fir-crowned hills melodramatic and tragical
significances.&nbsp; Such an one is Gallows Hill, where the road
goes in a hollow formed by the massive shoulders of the
tree-studded <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>height.&nbsp; Here, the gossips say, with the
incertitude of rustic indifference, a man hanged himself, or was
hanged.&nbsp; When or why he committed what we have the authority
of conventional old-time journalism for calling &ldquo;the rash
deed,&rdquo; does not&mdash;in the same
language&mdash;&ldquo;transpire.&rdquo;&nbsp; But certainly he
selected a romantic spot for ending, for from the ragged crest,
underneath one of those &ldquo;clumps and stretches of fir-trees,
whose notched tops are like battlemented towers crowning
black-fronted castles of enchantment,&rdquo; the moorland, under
the different local names of Hyde Heath, Decoy Heath, and Gore
Heath, but all one to the eye, goes stretching away some ten
miles, to Poole Harbour, seen from this view-point, on moonlit
nights, glancing like a mirror in a field of black velvet.</p>

juicy interlude to the summer dryness of these wastes is that dip
in the road where one comes to the river Piddle at
Chamberlain&rsquo;s Bridge, a battered old red brick pont that,
by the aid of the quietly gliding stream and the dark, boding
mass of fir-crowned Mat Hill in the background, makes a memorable
picture.&nbsp; Only when Bere Regis comes within sight are the
solitudes of Egdon left behind.&nbsp; Steeply down goes the way
into the village, down Rye Hill, past the remarkably picturesque
old thatched cottage illustrated here, perched on its steep
roadside bank, and so at last on to the level where Bere Church
is glimpsed, standing four-square and handsome in advance of the
long street, backed by dense clumps of that tree, the fir, which
has so strong an affection for these sandy heaths.&nbsp; Here
then is the introduction to the
&ldquo;Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill&rdquo; of the Wessex novels, the
&ldquo;half-dead townlet . . . the spot of all spots in the world
which could be considered the D&rsquo;Urbervilles&rsquo; home,
since they had resided there for full five hundred
years.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">BERE REGIS</p>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> &ldquo;blinking little
place,&rdquo; and now perhaps a not even blinking, but fast
asleep village, was at one time a market-town, and, more than
that, as its latinised name would imply, a royal residence.&nbsp;
Kingsbere, said to mean &ldquo;Kingsbury&rdquo;&mdash;that is to
say, &ldquo;King&rsquo;s place&rdquo; or building&mdash;really
obtained its name in very different fashion.&nbsp; It was plain
&ldquo;Bere,&rdquo; long before the Saxon monarchs came to this
spot and caused the latter-day confusion among antiquaries of the
British &ldquo;bere,&rdquo; meaning an underwood, a scrub, copse,
bramble, or thorn-bed, with the Anglo-Saxon
&ldquo;byrig.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have but to look upon the
surroundings of Bere Regis even at this day, a thousand years
later, to see how truly descriptive that British name really
was.&nbsp; It was of old a place greatly favoured by royalty,
from that remote age when Elfrida murdered her stepson, Edward
the King and Martyr, at Corfe Castle, and thrashed her own son
Ethelred here with a large wax candle, for reproaching her with
the deed.&nbsp; Those events happened in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 978, and it is therefore not in any
way surprising that no traces of the ferocious Queen
Elfrida&rsquo;s residence have survived.&nbsp; Ethelred, we are
told, hated wax candles ever after <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>that severe thrashing, and doubtless
hated Bere as well; but it was more than ever a royal resort in
the later times of King John, who visited it on several occasions
in the course of his troubled reign.&nbsp; Thenceforward,
however, the favours of monarchs ceased, and it came to depend
upon the good will of the Abbots of Tarent Abbey and that of the
Turbervilles, who between them became owners of the manor.</p>
<p>The village street of Bere is bleak and barren.&nbsp; It is a
street of rustic cottages of battered red brick, or a compost of
mud, chopped straw, and lime, called &ldquo;cob,&rdquo; built on
a brick base, often plastered, almost all of them thatched: some
with new thatch, some with thatch middle-aged, others yet with
thatch ancient and decaying, forming a rich and fertile bed for
weeds and ox-eyed daisies and &ldquo;bloody warriors,&rdquo; as
the local Dorsetshire name is for the rich red
wall-flowers.&nbsp; Sometimes the old thatch has been stripped
before the new was placed: more often it has not, and the merest
casual observer can, as he passes, easily become a critic of the
thoroughness or otherwise with which the thatcher&rsquo;s work
has been performed, not only by sight of the different shades
belonging to old and new, but by the varying thicknesses with
which the roofs are seen to be covered.&nbsp; Here an upstairs
window looks out immediately, open-eyed, upon the sunlight; there
another peers blinkingly forth, as behind beetling eyebrows, from
half a yard&rsquo;s depth of straw and reed, shading off from a
coal-black substratum to a coffee-coloured layer, and thence to
the amber top-coating of the latest addition.&nbsp; Warm in
winter, cool in summer, is the testimony of cottagers towards <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>thatch; and
earwiggy always, thinks the stranger under such roofs, as he
observes quaint lepidoptera ensconced comfortably in his
bed.&nbsp; Picturesque it certainly is, expensive too, although
it may not generally be thought so; but it is more enduring than
cheap slates or tiles, and, according to many who should know, if
indeed their prejudices do not warp their statements, cheaper in
the long run.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image135" href="images/p135.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>It is, in fine, not easy to come to a definitive pronouncement
on the merits or demerits, the comparative cheapness or
costliness, of rival roofing materials.&nbsp; The cost of the
materials themselves, payments for laying them, and the
astonishing difference between the enduring qualities of thatch
well and thatch indifferently laid forbid certitude.&nbsp; But
all modern local authorities are opposed to thatch, chiefly on
the score of its liability to fire.&nbsp; All the many and
extensive fires of Dorsetshire have been caused by <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>ignited
thatch; or else, caused in other ways, have been spread and
magnified by it.&nbsp; Yet, here again your rustic will stoutly
defend the ancient roofing, and declare that while such a roof is
slowly smouldering, and before it bursts into a blaze, he can
dowse it with a pail of water.&nbsp; No doubt, but that water,
from a well perhaps two hundred feet deep, and that ladder from
some neighbour half-a-mile away, are sometimes not to be brought
to bear with the required celerity.</p>
<p>This, let it be fervently said, is not an attack upon thatch:
it is but the presentation of pros and cons, and is no argument
in favour of that last word in utilitarian hideousness,
corrugated galvanized iron, under whose shelter you freeze in
winter and fry in summer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are ruined cottages in the long street of
Bere, whose condition has been brought about by just such causes,
and whose continuation in that state is due, not to a redundancy
of dwellings, but because the Lady of the Manor at Charborough,
despising the insignificant rents here, will not trouble about,
or go to the expense of, rebuilding.</p>
<p>Hence the gaps in the long row, like teeth missing from a
jaw.</p>
<p>Not a little hard-featured and stern at first sight, owing to
the entire absence of the softening feature of gardens upon the
road, this long street of Bere has yet a certain self-reliant
strong-charactered aspect that brings respect.&nbsp; It has, too,
the most interesting and beautiful church, rich in historical,
and richer in literary, associations.</p>

<p>Bere Regis in its decay is a storehouse of old <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Dorset
speech and customs.&nbsp; To its cottagers vegetables are
&ldquo;gearden-tackle,&rdquo; sugar&mdash;at least, the moist
variety&mdash;is &ldquo;zand,&rdquo; and garden-flowers all have
quaint outlandish names.&nbsp; The rustic folk have a keen, if
homely philosophy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ef &rsquo;twarnt for the
belly,&rdquo; said one to the present writer, in allusion to cost
of living, &ldquo;back &rsquo;ud wear gold.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bere,&rdquo; said another&mdash;an
&lsquo;outlandish&rsquo; person he, who had only been settled in
the village a decade or so and accordingly was only regarded as a
stranger, and so indeed regarded himself&mdash;&ldquo;Bere, a
poor dra&rsquo;lattin twankyten pleace, ten mile from anywheer,
God help it!&rdquo; which is so very nearly true that, if you
consult the map you will find that Dorchester is ten miles
distant, Corfe Castle twelve, Wimborne twelve, Blandford eight,
and Wareham, the nearest town, seven miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill,&rdquo; as Mr. Hardy elects to
rechristen Bere Regis, owes the ultimate limb of that compound
name to Woodbury Hill, a lofty elevation rising like an
exaggerated down, but partly clothed with trees, on the outskirts
of Bere Regis.&nbsp; The novelist describes this scene of an
ancient annual fair, now much shrunken from its olden import,
rather as it was than as it is.&nbsp; &ldquo;Greenhill was the
Nijni Novgorod of South Wessex; and the busiest, merriest,
noisiest day of the whole statute number was the day of the
sheep-fair.&nbsp; This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a
hill, which retained in good preservation the remains of an
ancient earthwork, consisting of a huge rampart and entrenchment
of an oval form, encircling the top of the hill, though somewhat
broken down here and there.&nbsp; To each of the two openings, on
opposite sides, <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>a winding road ascended, and the level green space of
twenty or thirty acres enclosed by the bank was the site of the
fair.&nbsp; A few permanent erections dotted the spot, but the
majority of the visitors patronised canvas alone for resting and
feeding under during the time of their sojourn here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place looks interesting, viewed from beneath whence two
forlorn-looking houses are seen perched on the very ridge of the
windy height.&nbsp; But it is always best to remain below, and so
to keep romantic illusions; and here is no exception.&nbsp;
Climbing to the summit, those two houses are increased to fifteen
or seventeen red-brick, storm-beaten cottages, some thatched,
others slated, mostly uninhabited; all commonplace.&nbsp; The
fair is still held in September, beginning on the 18th, the
Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.&nbsp; Formerly it lasted a
week, and, at the rate of a hundred pounds a day in tolls to the
Lord of the Manor, brought that fortunate person an annual
&ldquo;unearned increment&rdquo; as the Radicals would call it,
of &pound;700.&nbsp; Nowadays those tolls are very much of a
negligible quantity.</p>
<p>Here it was, during the sheep fair, that Troy, supposed to
have long before been drowned in Lulworth Cove, but living and
masquerading as Mr. Francis, the Great Cosmopolitan Roughrider,
enacted the part of Dick Turpin in the canvas-covered show, and,
looking through a hole in the tent, unobserved himself, observed
Bathsheba, who had thought him dead.</p>
<p>The villagers of Bere look askance upon the dwellers on this
eyrie.&nbsp; They tell you &ldquo;they be gipsy vo&rsquo;k up
yon,&rdquo; and hold it to be the last resort of those declining
in worldly estate.&nbsp; Villagers <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>going, metaphorically, &ldquo;down
the hill&rdquo; in the direction of outdoor relief, move to the
less desirable cottages in the village, and then, complete penury
at last overtaking them, continue their moral and economic
descent by the geographical ascent of this hill of Woodbury,
whence they are at last removed to &ldquo;The Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below Woodbury Hill, on the edge of Bere Wood, the scene of an
old Turberville attempt at illegal enclosure, is rural Bloxworth,
whose little church contains the fine monument of Sir John
Trenchard &ldquo;of the ancient family of the Trenchards in
Dorsetshire,&rdquo; Sergeant-at-Law and Secretary of State in the
reign of William and Mary.&nbsp; He died in 1695, aged 46.&nbsp;
Ten years before, he had been an active sympathiser with the Duke
of Monmouth, in that ill-fated rebellion, and it is told, how,
when visiting one Mr. Speke at Ilchester, hearing that Jeffreys
had issued a warrant for his arrest, he instantly took horse,
rode to Poole and thence crossed to Holland, returning with the
Prince of Orange three years later.</p>
<p>Above all other interest at Bere is the beautiful church,
standing a little distance below the long-drawn village street,
and clearly from its character and details, a building cherished
and beautified by the Abbey of Tarent, by the Turbervilles, and
by Cardinal Archbishop Morton, native of the place.</p>
<p>The three-staged pinnacled tower is very fine, the lower stage
alternately of stone and flint, the three surmounting courses
diapered: the second and third stages treated wholly in that
chessboard fashion.&nbsp; The beautiful belfry windows, of three
lights, divided into three stages by transoms, are <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>filled with
pierced stonework.&nbsp; The exterior south wall of the church is
of alternate red brick and flint, in courses of threes.&nbsp;
There is a remarkable window in the west wall of the north aisle,
and in the south wall the exceptionally fine and unusual
Turberville <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>window, of late Gothic character and five lights,
filled in modern times by the Erle-Drax family, of Charborough,
with a series of stained-glass armorial shields, displaying the
red lion of the Turbervilles, all toe-nails and whiskers, and
ducally crowned, ramping against an ermine field, firstly by
himself and then conjointly with the arms of the families with
which the Turbervilles, in the course of many centuries, allied
themselves.&nbsp; The Erle-Draxes have not, in honouring the
extinct Turberville, forgotten themselves, for some of the
shields display their arms and those of the Sawbridges,
Grosvenors, Churchills, and Eggintons they married.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Entering, the building is seen to be even more beautiful than
without.&nbsp; Its most striking and unusual
feature&mdash;unusual in this part of the country&mdash;is the
extraordinarily gorgeous, elaborately carved and painted timber
roof, traditionally said to have been the gift of Cardinal
Morton, born at Milborne Stileman, in the parish of Bere
Regis.&nbsp; The hammer-beams are boldly carved into the shapes
of bishops, cardinals, and pilgrims, while the bosses are worked
into great faces that look down with a fat calm satisfaction that
must be infinitely reassuring to the congregations.</p>
<p>The bench ends are another interesting feature.&nbsp; Many are
old, others are new, done in the old style when the church was
admirably restored by Street.&nbsp; Had Sir Gilbert Scott been
let loose upon it, it may well be supposed that the surviving
bench-ends would have been cast out, and nice new articles by the
hands of his pet firm of ecclesiastical furnishers put in their
stead.&nbsp; One is dated, in <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Roman numerals, MCCCCCXLVII; another
is inscribed &ldquo;IOH. DAV. WAR. DENOF. THYS. CHARYS,&rdquo;
and another bears a merchant&rsquo;s mark, with the initial of
&ldquo;I. T.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Transitional Norman pillars are
bold and virile, with humorous carvings of that period strikingly
projecting from their capitals.&nbsp; It evidently seemed to that
now far-away waggish fellow who sculptured them that toothache
and headache were things worth caricaturing.&nbsp; Let us hope he
never suffered from them, but he evidently took as models some
who were such martyrs.</p>

<p>But the centre of interest to us in these pages is by the
Turberville window in the south aisle, beneath whose gorgeous
glass is the great ledger-stone, covering the last resting-place
of the extinct family.&nbsp; It is boldly lettered:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Ostium sepulchri
antiquae</i><br />
<i>Famillae Turberville</i><br />
<i>24 Junij 1710</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>The door of the
sepulchre</i><br />
<i>of the ancient family</i><br />
<i>of the Turbervilles</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the wall beneath the window is a defaced Purbeck marble
altar-tomb, and four others neighbour it.&nbsp; These are the
tombs described in <i>Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i> as
&ldquo;canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their brasses torn from
their matrices, <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>the rivet-holes remaining, like marten-holes in a
sand-cliff,&rdquo; and it was on one of those that Alec
D&rsquo;Urberville lay prone, in pretence of being an effigy of
one of her ancestors, when Tess was exploring the twilight
church.</p>
<p>The great monumental <i>History of Dorsetshire</i> tells the
enquirer a good deal of the Turbervilles who, being themselves
all dead and gone to their place, have, with a slight alteration
in the spelling of their name served as a peg on which to hang
the structure of one of the finest exercises ever made in the art
of novel writing.&nbsp; It seems that the Turbervilles descended
from one Sir Pagan or Payne Turberville, or de Turbida Villa, who
is shown in the Roll of Battle Abbey&mdash;or was shown, before
that Roll was accidentally burnt&mdash;to have come over with the
Conqueror.&nbsp; After the Battle of Hastings he seems to have
been one of twelve knights who helped Robert Fitz Hamon, Lord of
Estremaville, in his unholy enterprises, and then to have
returned to England when his over-lord was created Earl of
Gloucester.&nbsp; He warred in that lord&rsquo;s service, in the
Norman conquest of Glamorgan, and was rewarded with a tit-bit of
spoil there, in the shape of the lordship of Coyty.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry III. a certain John de Turberville is
found paying an annual fee or fine in respect of some land in the
forest of Bere, which an ancestor of his had impudently
endeavoured to enclose out of the estate of the Earl of Hereford;
and in 1297 a member of the family is found in the neighbourhood
of Bere Regis.&nbsp; This Brianus de Thorberville, or Bryan
Turberville, was lord of the manor, called from its situation on
the river Piddle, <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>and from himself, &ldquo;Piddle Turberville,&rdquo; and
now represented by the little village called Bryan&rsquo;s
Piddle.</p>

<p>At a later period the rising fortunes of this family are
attested by their coming into possession of half of the manor of
Bere Regis, the other half being, as it had long been, the
property of Tarent Abbey.&nbsp; <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Still later, when at last that Abbey
was dissolved, the Turbervilles were in the enjoyment of good
fortune, for the other half of the manor then came to them.&nbsp;
This period seems to have marked the summit of their advancement,
for from that time they gradually but surely decayed, giving
point to the old superstition which dates the decadence of many
an old family from that day when it sacrilegiously was awarded
the spoils of the Church.&nbsp; This fall from position began in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but D&rsquo;Albigny Turberville,
the oculist who was consulted by Pepys the diarist, and
eventually died in 1696, as the tomb to him with the fulsome
inscription in Salisbury Cathedral tells us, was a distinguished
scion of the ancient race, as also was &ldquo;George Turberville,
gentleman,&rdquo; and poet, born at Winterborne Whitchurch, and
publishing books of poems and travels in 1570.&nbsp; These,
doubtless, were not forms of distinction that would have
commended themselves to those old fighting and land-snatching
Turbervilles; but, other times, other manners.</p>
<p>The last Turberville of Bere Regis was that Thomas Turberville
over whom the ancient vault of his stock finally closed in
1710.&nbsp; His twin daughters and co-heiresses, Frances and
Elizabeth, born here in 1703, sold the property and left for
London.&nbsp; They died at Purser&rsquo;s Cross, Fulham, near
London, early in 1780, and were buried together at Putney.&nbsp;
Shortly afterwards their old manor-house of Bere Regis, standing
near the church, was allowed to lapse into ruin, and thus their
kin became only a memory where they had ruled so long.&nbsp; Of
the old branch of the family settled in Glamorganshire, a Colonel
Turberville remains the representative, but <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>the
position of the various rustics who in Dorset and Wilts bear the
name, corrupted variously into Tollafield and Troublefield, is
open to the suspicion that they are the descendants of
illegitimate offspring of that race.&nbsp; There remained,
indeed, until quite recent years a humble family of
&ldquo;Torevilles&rdquo; in Bere Regis, one of whom persisted in
calling himself &ldquo;Sir John.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as Mr. Hardy
says, in the course of <i>Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>,
instances of the gradual descent of legitimate scions of the old
knightly families, down and again downwards until they have
become mere farm-labourers, are not infrequent in Wilts and
Dorset.&nbsp; Their high-sounding names have undergone outrageous
perversions, as in the stated instance of courtly Paridelle into
rustic Priddle; but, although they have inherited no worldly gear
they own the same blood.</p>

148</span>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">THE HEART OF THE
HARDY COUNTRY</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorchester</span> is not only the capital
of Dorset: it is also the chief town of the Hardy Country.&nbsp;
The ancient capital of Wessex was Winchester: the chief seat of
this literary domain is here, beside the Frome.&nbsp; Four miles
distant from it the novelist was born, and at Max Gate,
Fordington, looking down upon Dorchester&rsquo;s roofs, he
resides.</p>
<p>The old country life still closely encircles the county town,
and on market-days takes the place by storm; so that when, by
midday, most of the carriers from a ten or fifteen miles radius
have deposited their country folk, and the farmers have come in
on horseback, or driving, or perhaps by train, the slighter
forms, less ruddy faces, and more urban dress of the townsfolk
are lost amid the great army of occupation that from farms,
cottages, dairies, and sheep-pastures, has for the rest of the
day taken possession of the streets.&nbsp; The talk is all of the
goodness or badness of the hay crop, the prospects of the
harvest, how swedes are doing, and the condition of cows, sheep,
and pigs; or, if it be on toward autumn, when the hiring of
farm-labourers, shepherds, and rural servants in general for the
next twelve months is the engrossing topic, <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>then the
scarcity of hands and their extravagant demands are the themes of
much animated talk.</p>
<p>Dorchester faithfully at such times reflects the image of
Dorset, and Dorset remains to this day, and long may it so
remain, a great sheep-breeding and grazing county, and equally
great as a land of rich dairies.&nbsp; From that suburb of
Fordington, which has for so very many centuries been a suburb
that to those who know it the name bears no suburban connotation,
you may look down, as from a cliff-top, and see the river Frome
winding away amid the rich grazing pastures, and with one ear
hear the cows calling, while with the other the cries of the
newspaper boys are heard in the streets of the town.&nbsp; The
scent of the hay and the drowsy hum of the bees break across the
top of the bluff, and, just as one may read, in the exquisite
description of these things in the pages of <i>The Mayor of
Casterbridge</i>, the dandelion <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>and other winged seeds float in at
open windows.&nbsp; One may sometimes from this point, when the
foliage of its dense screen of trees grows thin, see Stinsford,
the &ldquo;Mellstock&rdquo; of that idyllic tale, <i>Under the
Greenwood Tree</i>; but in general you can see nothing of that
sequestered spot until you have reached the by-lane out of the
main road from Dorchester, and, turning there to the right, come
to Stinsford Church, along a way made a midday twilight by those
trees which render the title of that story so descriptive.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Blue wood-smoke, curling up from cottage chimneys against the
massed woodlands that surround Kingston House, grey church,
largely ivy-covered and plentifully endowed with grotesque
gurgoyles&mdash;these, with school-house and scattered cottages,
make the sum-total of Stinsford, or
&ldquo;Mellstock.&rdquo;&nbsp; The school-house is that of the
young school-mistress, Fancy Day, in the story; and suggests
romance; but the sentimental pilgrim may be excused for being of
opinion that it is all in the book, with perhaps nothing left
over for real life.&nbsp; At any rate, passing it, as the
scholars within are, like bees, in Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;humming small,&rdquo; one does not linger, but speculates
more or less idly which was the cottage where Tranter Dewy lived,
and which that of Geoffrey Day, the keeper of Yalbury Great
Wood.&nbsp; There are not, after all, many cottages to choose
from, and Mr. Hardy has so largely peopled his stories from
Mellstock that each one might well be a literary landmark.&nbsp;
The Fiddler of the Reels, Mop Ollamoor, a rustic Paganini, whose
diabolical cleverness with his violin is the subject of a short
story, lived in one of these <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>thatched homes of rural content, and
in another was born unhappy Jude the Obscure.&nbsp; In each one
of the rest you can imaginatively find the home of a member of
that famous Mellstock choir, whose performances and enthusiasm
sometimes rose so &ldquo;glorious grand&rdquo; that those who
wrought with stringed instruments almost sawed through the
strings of fiddle and double-bass, and those others whose weapons
were of brass blew upon them until they split the seams of their
coats and sent their waistcoat-buttons flying with the force of
their fervid harmony, in the cumulative strains of Handel and the
dithyrambics of Tate and Brady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! for such a man
in our parish,&rdquo; was thought to be the admiratory attitude
of the parson at the <i>fortissimo</i> outburst of a minstrel
from a neighbouring village, who had taken a turn with the local
choir; but the parson&rsquo;s pose was less one of admiration
than of startled surprise.</p>
<p>All the members of that harmonious, if at times too vigorous,
choir are gone to the land where, let us hope, they are quiring
in the white robes and golden crowns usually supposed to be the
common wear &ldquo;up along&rdquo;; and their instruments are
perished too:</p>
<blockquote><p>The knight is dust, his sword is rust,<br />
His soul is with the saints, we trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, as Mr. Hardy, in <i>Friends Beyond</i>, says of his own
creations:</p>
<blockquote><p>William Dewy, Tranter Reuben,<br />
Farmer Ledlow late at plough,<br />
Robert&rsquo;s kin, and John&rsquo;s, and Ned&rsquo;s,<br />
And the Squire and Lady Susan<br />
Lie in Mellstock churchyard now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>The
clergy, who were responsible for the disappearance of the old
choirs, did not succeed at one stroke in sweeping them away, and
in many parishes it was not until the leader had died that they
broke up the old rustic harmony.&nbsp; &ldquo;The &lsquo;church
singers,&rsquo; who played anthems, with selections &lsquo;from
Handel, but mostly composed by themselves,&rsquo; had a position
in their parish.&nbsp; They had an admiring congregation.&nbsp;
Their afternoon anthem was the theme of conversation at the
church porch before the service, and of enquiry and critical
disquisition after.&nbsp; &lsquo;And did John,&rsquo; one would
ask, &lsquo;keep to his time?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Samuel was
crowding very fitly until his string broked.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
was said after a performance difficult in all the categories in
which difficulty&mdash;close up even to impossibility&mdash;may
be found.&nbsp; And there was, I was about to say, a finale, but
it seemed endless; it was a concluding portion, and a long one,
of the anthem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary began an introductory recapitulation, in which she
was ably followed, of the words, the subject of the composition,
the masterpiece of one, or many, if the choir had lent a helping
hand.&nbsp; It happened that Mary had to manage three full
syllables, and all the cadences, and trills, and quavers
connected therewith, as a solo.&nbsp; Then followed, through all
the turns of the same intricate piece, Thomas, of tenor voice,
who evolved his music, but did not advance to any elucidation of
the subject of his concluding effort.&nbsp; He only dwelt upon
the same syllables, at which the good minister was seen to smile
and become restless, particularly when Jonathan took on with his
deep bass voice, accompanied by the tones he drew from his <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>bass-viol.&nbsp; He, as best suited a bass singer,
slowly repeated the syllables that Mary and Thomas had produced
in so many ways, and with such a series of intonations,
&lsquo;<span
class="GutSmall">OUR&mdash;GREAT&mdash;SAL</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
May some who tittered at this canonisation of, as it were, a
female saint, be forgiven!&rsquo;&nbsp; Had they waited a few
minutes, the grand union of all the performers in loud chorus
would have enlightened them to the fact that the last syllable
was only the first of one of three ending in
&lsquo;<i>vation</i>,&rsquo; which would be loudly repeated by
the whole choir till they appeared fairly tired out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very last surviving vestige of the old village choirs of
the West of England became extinct in 1893.&nbsp; Until then the
startled visitor from London, or indeed any other part of a
country by that time given over to harmoniums in chapels, cheap
and thin organs in small churches, and more full-toned ones in
larger, would have found the village choir of Martinstown still
bass-viol and fiddle-scraping, flute-blowing, and
clarionet-playing, as their forefathers had been wont to
do.&nbsp; &ldquo;Martinstown&rdquo; is the style by which Wessex
folk, not quite equal to the constant daily repetition of the
name of Winterborne St. Martin, know that village, a little to
the west of Dorchester.&nbsp; It is a considerable place and by
no means remote, and it was therefore not the general
inaccessibility of Martinstown to modern ideas that caused this
survival, when every other parish had put away such things.&nbsp;
Martinstown then provided itself with an organ, as understood
to-day; and so escaped a middle period to which many another
parish fell a victim, between the decay of the old church music
and <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>the
adoption of the new.&nbsp; When, about the accession of Queen
Victoria, village minstrelsy began to relax, there came in a
fashion, or rather a scourge, of mechanical barrel-organs, fitted
to play a dozen or fewer, sacred tunes, according to the local
purse, or the local requirements.&nbsp; Precisely like secular
barrel organs, save only in the matter of the tunes they were
constructed to play, church minstrelsy with them not only became
mechanical but singularly unvaried, for, when your dozen tunes
were played, there was nothing for it&mdash;if, like Oliver
Twist, the congregation called for more&mdash;but to grind the
same things over again.&nbsp; The only variety&mdash;and that was
one not covenanted for&mdash;was when portions of the
melody-producing works decayed and broke off.&nbsp; A tooth
missing from a cog-wheel, or something wrong with the barrel, was
apt to give an ungodly twist to the Old Hundredth, calculated to
impart a novelty to that ancient stand-by of village churches,
and would even have made the air of &ldquo;Onward, Christian
Soldiers!&rdquo; stream forth in spasms, as though those soldiers
were an awkward squad learning some ecclesiastical
goose-step.&nbsp; In short, the barrel-organs were not
&ldquo;things seemly and of good report,&rdquo; and they
presently died the death.</p>
<p>Many regretted the old order of things, largely destroyed by
the current movements in the Church.&nbsp; Reforming High
Churchmen had seized upon the signs of weakness exhibited in the
old choirs, and had made away with them wherever possible.&nbsp;
The rustic music had, as we have seen, its humorous incidents,
but it was enthusiastic and was understood and sympathised with
by the people.&nbsp; <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Surpliced choirs, and others, formed
as they now commonly are, from classes superior to those of which
the old instrumental and vocal choirs were composed, have not
that hold upon congregations, who do not sing, as the Prayer-book
and the Psalm enjoin, but listen while others do the singing for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, daze my old eyes,&rdquo; said a Wessex rustic,
reviewing the trend of modern life, &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s
upsey-down.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis, if ye want this and if ye want
that, put yer hand in yer pocket and goo an&rsquo; git
some&rsquo;un to do&rsquo;t for ye, or goo to the Stowers (he

&rsquo;ee, tidden no manner of good yer liftin&rsquo; up yer

Ef ye do&rsquo;t passon looks all of a pelt, and they boys in
their nightshirts sets off a-sniggerin&rsquo; and they tells yer
ye bissen much of a songster, they ses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has already been said that the instruments, as well as the
old village players of them, have perished, but at least one
specimen of that oddly named instrument, the
&ldquo;serpent,&rdquo; frequently mentioned by Mr. Hardy, has
survived.&nbsp; This example is in the possession of Messrs. H.
Potter &amp; Co., of West Street, Charing Cross Road.&nbsp; The
serpent belongs to such a past order of things that, like the
rebecs, dulcimers, and shawms of Scriptural references, it
requires explanation.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;serpent,&rdquo; then, it may be learned, although
<a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>invented
by one Guillaume so far back as the close of the sixteenth
century, first came into general use in the early part of the
eighteenth.&nbsp; It was a wind instrument, the precursor of the
bass horn, or ophicleide, which in its turn has been superseded
by the valved bass brasses of the present day.&nbsp; The serpent
of course owed its name to its contorted shape.&nbsp; It was
generally made of wood, covered with leather, and stained black,
and ranged in length from about twenty-nine to thirty-three
inches.&nbsp; The earlier form of serpent had but six holes, but
these were gradually increased, and keyed, until this now
obsolete instrument, as improved by Key, of London, about the
beginning of the nineteenth century, finally became possessed of
seventeen keys.&nbsp; It went out of use, contemporaneously with
the decay of the old village choirs, about 1830.</p>
<p>The geographical area of the heart of the Hardy Country is not
very great, but the difficulties of finding one&rsquo;s way about
it are not small.&nbsp; The Vale of Great Dairies opens out, and
the many runnels of the Frome make the byways so winding that to
clearly know whither one is going demands the use of a very
large-scale Ordnance Map.&nbsp; But to lose one&rsquo;s self here
is no disaster.&nbsp; You will find your way out again, and in
the meanwhile will have come into intimate touch with dairying,
and perhaps, if it be early summer, will find the barns and the
waterside busy with sheepshearers.&nbsp; Seeing the dexterous
shearing, the quick, practised movements of the men and the
panting helplessness of the sheep, one is reminded of the similar
scene in <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>.</p>
<p>Away across the Frome is the rustic, <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>out-of-the-way village of West Stafford, which has a
little one-aisled church, still displaying the royal arms of the
time of Queen Elizabeth with that sem&eacute;e of lilies, the
empty boast of a sovereignty over France, which, to the
contemplative and sentimental student of history is as pitiful a
make-believe as that of penury apeing affluence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That glorious <i>Semper Eadem</i>,&rdquo; motto,
&ldquo;our banner and our pride,&rdquo; as Macaulay says, looks a
little flatulent in these circumstances of a relaxed grasp.</p>
<p>The long rhymed inscription outside an off-licence beerhouse
in the village, displaying the Hardyean phrase of &ldquo;a cup of
genuine&rdquo; for a glass of ale, is a curiosity in its
way&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I trust no Wise Man will condemn<br />
A Cup of Genuine now and then.<br />
When you are faint, your spirits low,<br />
Your string relaxed &rsquo;twill bend your Bow,<br />
Brace your Drumhead and make you tight,<br />
Wind up your Watch and set you right:<br />
But then again the too much use<br />
Of all strong liquors is the abuse.<br />
&rsquo;Tis liquid makes the solid loose,<br />
The Texture and whole frame Destroys,<br />
But health lies in the Equipoise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resuming the north bank of the Frome, and the road to
Tincleton, a left-hand turning is seen leading across to
Piddletown, by way of Lower and Upper Bockhampton&mdash;hamlets
rustic to the last degree, and, by reason of being quite remote
from any road the casual stranger is likely to take, unknown to
the outside world.&nbsp; Yet the second of these, the thatched
and tree-embowered hamlet of Upper Bockhampton, has the keenest
interest for the <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>explorer of the Hardy Country, for it was here, in the
rustic, thatched cottage still occupied by members of the Hardy
family, that Thomas Hardy, novelist and poet, was born, June 2nd,
1840.&nbsp; It is a fitting spot for the birthplace of one who
has described nature as surely it has never before been
described, has pictured the moods of earth and sky, and has heard
and given new significances to the voices of birds and trees, by
the stubborn and intractable method of prose-writing.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The cottage stands&mdash;its front almost hid from sight in
the dense growths of its old garden and by the slope of the
downs&mdash;at the extreme upper end of Upper Bockhampton, on the
edge of the wild, <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>called, with a fine freedom of choice, Bockhampton or
Piddletown Heath, and Thorneycombe or Ilsington Woods.&nbsp; You
enter its garden up steep, rustic steps, and find its low-ceiled
rooms stone-flagged and criss-crossed with beams.&nbsp; At the
back, its walls, with <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>small latticed windows, look sheer
upon a lane leading into the heart of the woodland; where, so
little are strangers expected or desired that the tree-trunks
bear notice-boards detailing what shall be done to those who
trespass.&nbsp; Branches of these enshrining trees touch the
thatched roof and scrape the walls, and the voices of the wind
and of the woodlands reverberate from them; and when the sun goes
down, the nocturnal orchestra of owls and nightingales strikes
up.&nbsp; It is an ideal spot for the birth of one whose genius
and bent are largely in the interpretation of nature; but it must
not be forgotten that the chances are always against the
observation and appreciation of scenes amidst which a child has
been born and reared, and that only exceptional receptivity can
throw off the usual effect of staleness and lack of interest in
things usual and accustomed.&nbsp; It is thus in the nature of
things that the townsman generally takes a keener interest in the
country than those native to it, and the dweller in the mushroom
cities of commerce finds more in a cathedral city than many of
those living within the shadow of the Minster ever suspect.&nbsp;
This is to say, parabolically, what we all know, that the nature
of the seer is an exceptional nature, and rises superior to the
dulling effects of use and wont: unaccountable as the winds that
blow, and not to be analysed or predicated by any literary
meteorological department.</p>

<p>Returning through Lower Bockhampton, on the way to Tincleton,
a ridge is presently seen on the left hand, crowned with
fir-trees, and a little questing will reveal a rush-grown pool,
the original of Heedless William&rsquo;s Pond, mentioned in

Norris Mill Farm, where, overlooking the Vale of Great Dairies,
is the original of Talbothays, the dairy where Angel Clare,
learning the business from Dairyman Crick, met Tess.&nbsp; Below
the grassy bluff on whose sides the farm-buildings stand may be
traced the fertilising course of the Frome, or as Mr. Hardy calls
it, the Var:&mdash;&ldquo;The Var waters were clear as the pure
River of Life shown to the Evangelist, rapid as the shadow of a
cloud, with pebbly shadows that prattled to the sky all day
long.&nbsp; There the water-flower was the lily.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>This land of fat kine and water-meads, to the south of the
road, is neighboured to the northward by the outlying brown and
purple stretches of Egdon Heath, into whose wilds we shall
presently come.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bloom&rsquo;s End,&rdquo; or a house
that may well <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>stand for it, we have noticed, and now come upon a
humble little farm on the right hand, standing with front to the
road and facing upon a strikingly gloomy heather-covered
hill.&nbsp; This is the house, once the &ldquo;Duck&rdquo; inn,
which figures in <i>The Return of the Native</i> as the
&ldquo;Quiet Woman&rdquo; inn, kept by Damon Wildeve, who, a
failure as an engineer, made a worse shipwreck of life
here.&nbsp; As described in the novel, a little patch of land has
by dint of supreme exertions been reclaimed from the grudging
soil:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wildeve&rsquo;s Patch, as it was called, a plot of land
redeemed from the heath, and after long and laborious years
brought into cultivation.&nbsp; The man who had discovered that
it could be tilled died of the labour: the man who succeeded him
in possession ruined himself in fertilising it.&nbsp; Wildeve
came like Amerigo Vespucci, and received the honours due to those
who had gone before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A casual talk with the small farmer who has taken the place
reveals the fact that this soil is a hard taskmaster and yields a
poor recompense.&nbsp; The heathery hill facing it is described
exactly as it is in nature:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The front of the house was towards the heath and
Rainbarrow, whose dark shape seemed to threaten it from the sky.
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a barrow.&nbsp; This bossy projection of earth
above its natural level occupied the loftiest ground of the
loneliest height that the heath contained.&nbsp; Although from
the vale it appeared but as a wart on an Atlantean brow, its
actual bulk was great.&nbsp; It formed the pole and axis of this
heathery world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>The
soil at the back of the house is better, which indeed it could
well be without being even then particularly good.&nbsp; It
slopes towards the river, at what is described in the book as
&ldquo;Shadwater Weir,&rdquo; where the drowned bodies of Wildeve
and Eustacia were found:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The garden was at the back, and behind this
ran a still deep stream.&rdquo;</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The village of Tincleton, the &ldquo;Stickleford&rdquo; of
casual mention in some of the short stories, is one of about a
dozen cottages, clustering round a little church and school; and
with presumably a few dozen more dwellings in the neighbourhood
of the wide common on which Tincleton stands, to account for the
existence of that school and that church.&nbsp; Past it and
Pallington, whose hill and hilltop firs, known as Pallington
Clump, are conspicuous for great distances, we turn to the left
and explore a portion of Egdon Heath towards Bryan&rsquo;s Piddle
and Bere Regis.&nbsp; Everywhere the wilds now stretch forth and
seem to bid defiance to the best efforts of the cultivator, but
down at the hamlet of Hurst, where water is plentiful, there is
an ancient red-brick farm <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>of superior aspect, and yet with a
thatched roof&mdash;an effect oddly like that which might be
produced by a gentleman wearing a harvester&rsquo;s hat.&nbsp; It
is obviously an old manor-house, and besides showing evidences of
former state, has two substantial brick entrance piers surmounted
by what country folk, in their native satire, call
&ldquo;gentility balls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such gentility in the neighbourhood of wild, uncanny Egdon
wears, as Mr. Hardy would say, &ldquo;an anomalous
look.&rdquo;&nbsp; The heath is more akin with Adam than with his
descendants:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This obscure, obsolete, superseded country
figures in Domesday.&nbsp; Its condition is recorded therein as
that of heathy, furzy, briary
wilderness&mdash;&lsquo;Bruaria.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then follows the
length and breadth in leagues; and, though some uncertainty
exists as to the exact extent of this ancient lineal measure, it
appears from the figures that the area of Egdon down to the
present day has but little diminished.&nbsp; &lsquo;Turbaria
Bruaria&rsquo;&mdash;the right of cutting heath-turf&mdash;occurs
in charters relating to the district.&nbsp; &lsquo;Overgrown with
heth and mosse,&rsquo; says Leland of the same dark sweep of
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here at least were intelligible facts regarding the
landscape&mdash;far-reaching proofs productive of genuine
satisfaction.&nbsp; The untamable Ishmaelitish thing that Egdon
now was it always had been.&nbsp; Civilisation was its enemy; and
ever since the beginning of vegetation its soil had worn the same
antique brown dress, the natural and invariable garment of the
particular formation.&nbsp; In its venerable one coat lay a
certain vein of satire on human vanity in clothes.&nbsp; A person
on a heath in raiment of modern cut and colours has more or less
an anomalous <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>look.&nbsp; We seem to want the oldest and simplest
human clothing where the clothing of the earth is so

<p>Here, if anywhere in this poor old England of ours, generally
over-populated and sorted over, raked about, and turned inside
out, there is quiet and solitude.&nbsp; No recent manifestations
of the way the world wags, no advertisement hoardings, no
gasometers or mean suburbs intrude upon the inviolable
heath.&nbsp; No one has yet suspected coal beneath the shaggy
frieze coat of this remote vestige of an earlier age, and its
vitals have therefore not been probed and dragged forth.&nbsp; A
railway skirts it, &rsquo;tis true, but only on the way
otherwhere, and no network of sidings has yet made a gridiron of
its unexploited waste.&nbsp; Elsewhere trim hedges or fences of
barbed-wire restrain the explorer, but here he is free to roam,
and may so roam until he has fairly lost himself.</p>

<p>I know just such a farm, in the dip of the yellow road, its
thatched roofs and the near trees taking on a homely, comfortable
look when night <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

its surroundings seem most closely to fit his imaginings.&nbsp;
The place has just that personality he gives his farmsteads, and
the wastes near it wear sometimes just that cold indifference to
humanity, and at others precisely that ogreish hostility, he in
his pagan way describes.</p>
<p>Halting here, as the sun goes down, and the landscape changes
from its daylight browns and purples to an irradiated orange, and

168</span>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">DORCHESTER TO
CROSS-IN-HAND, MELBURY, AND YEOVIL</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">good</span> many outlying literary
landmarks of the Wessex novels may be cleared up by leaving
Dorchester by Charminster, and then, at a fork in the road just
past Wolveton, taking the left-hand turning and following for
awhile the valley road along the course of the river Frome.&nbsp;
Not for long, however, if it is desired to keep strictly to those
landmarks, do we pursue this easy course, for in another couple
of miles, by Grimstone station, we shall have to bear to the
right hand and make for what is known in Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s pages
as &ldquo;Long Ash Lane,&rdquo; along whose almost interminable
course Farmer Darton and his friend rode, to the wooing of Sally
Hall, at Great Hintock, in that short story, <i>Interlopers at
the Knap</i>.</p>
<p>Long Ash Lane&mdash;in some editions of the novels styled
&ldquo;Holloway Lane&rdquo;&mdash;is the middle one of three
roads past Grimstone station.&nbsp; Those on either side lead
severally to Maiden Newton&mdash;the &ldquo;Chalk Newton&rdquo;
of <i>Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>&mdash;and to Sydling
St. Nicholas; but this is, as described in that story, &ldquo;a
monotonous track, without a village or hamlet for many miles, and
with very seldom a <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>turning.&rdquo;&nbsp; For its own sake, it will
therefore be easily seen, Long Ash Lane is not an altogether
desirable route.&nbsp; It is an ancient Roman road, running
eventually to Yeovil and Ilchester; passing near by, but not
touching, and always out of sight of several small villages on
its lengthy way.&nbsp; Darton and Johns found it weariful as they
rode, the hedgerow twigs on either side &ldquo;currycombing their
whiskers,&rdquo; as Mr. Hardy delightfully says; and wayfarers on
foot, tired out, believe at last that it will never end:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unapprised wayfarers, who are too old, or too young, or
in other respects too weak for the distance to be traversed, but
who, nevertheless, have to walk it, say, as they look wistfully
ahead: &lsquo;Once at the top of that hill, and I must surely see
the end of Long Ash Lane!&rsquo;&nbsp; But they reach the
hill-top, and Long Ash Lane stretches in front mercilessly as
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After many miles this tiresome road at last comes in touch
with modern life, for Evershot station and the hamlet of Holywell
are placed directly beside it.&nbsp; Here we may turn right, or
turn left, or go onward, sure in all directions of finding many
scenes to be identified with the novels.&nbsp; Turning to the
right, a road not altogether dissimilar in its loneliness from
Long Ash Lane is found, but differing from it in the one
essential respect of ascending the ridge of lofty downs
overlooking the Vale of Blackmoor, and thus, while to the right
hand disclosing a dull expanse of table-land, on the left opening
out a romantic view, bounded only by distance and the
inadequacies of human eyesight.&nbsp; This is the road along
which Tess was <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>travelling&mdash;in the reverse direction&mdash;from
Dole&rsquo;s Ash Farm at Plush, the &ldquo;Flintcombe Ash&rdquo;
of those tragical pages, to Beaminster or
&ldquo;Emminster,&rdquo; to visit the parents of Angel Clare, her
husband, when she came to that ill-fated meeting with Alec
D&rsquo;Urberville at the spot we now approach,
Cross-in-Hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length the road touched the spot called
&lsquo;Cross-in-Hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of all spots on the bleached
and desolate upland this was the most forlorn.&nbsp; It was so
far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by
artists and view-lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty, a
negative beauty of tragic tone.&nbsp; The place took its name
from a stone pillar which stood there, a strange rude monolith,
from a stratum unknown in any local quarry, on which was roughly
carved a human hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The history and meaning of this lonely pillar on the solitary
ridgeway road are unknown.&nbsp; Thought by some to mark the
old-time bounds of property under the sway of the Abbot of Cerne,
others have considered it to be the relic of a wayside cross,
while others yet have held it to be a place of meeting of the
tenants and feudatories of the old abbey, and the hollow in the
stone to have been the receptacle for their tribute.&nbsp; But,
&ldquo;whatever the origin of the relic, there was and is
something sinister, or solemn, according to mood, in the scene
amid which it stands; something tending to impress the most
phlegmatic passer-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here it was that Tess, on her way to Flintcombe Ash, was
surprised by the converted Alec D&rsquo;Urberville, already
shaken in his new-found grace and preaching mission at sight of
her, and here he made <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>her swear upon it never to tempt him
by her charms or ways.&nbsp; &ldquo;This was once a Holy
Cross,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Relics are not in my creed,
but I fear you at moments.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not very
reassuring to Tess when, leaving the spot of this singular
rencounter and asking a rustic if the stone were not a Holy
Cross, he replied, &ldquo;Cross&mdash;no; &rsquo;twer not a
cross!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a thing of ill-omen, miss.&nbsp; It was
put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor, who was
tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards
hung.&nbsp; The bones lie underneath.&nbsp; They say he sold his
soul to the devil, and that he walks at times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This pillar, &ldquo;the scene of a miracle or murder, or
both,&rdquo; stands some five feet in height, and rises from the
unfenced grassy selvedge of the road, where the blackberry bushes
and bracken grow, on the verge of the down that breaks
precipitously away to the vale where Yetminster lies.&nbsp; The
rude <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Deep down below, in midst of the narrowest lanes, lies the
sequestered village of Batcombe, from which this down immediately
above takes its name.&nbsp; The church stands almost in the
shadow of the hills.&nbsp; This also is a place of marvellous
legends, for a battered old Gothic tomb in the churchyard,
innocent of inscription, standing near the north wall of the
church, is, according to old tales the resting-place of one
&ldquo;Conjuring Minterne,&rdquo; a devil-compeller and
astrologer of sorts, who was originally buried half in and half
out of the church, for fear his master, &ldquo;the horny
man,&rdquo; as a character in one of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s romances
calls Old Nick, should have him, if buried otherwise.&nbsp; One
would like to learn more about &ldquo;Conjuring Minterne&rdquo;
and his strange tricks, but history is silent.</p>
<p>Returning to Evershot, or, as it is styled in the sources of
our pilgrimage, &ldquo;Evershead,&rdquo; we come to Melbury Park,
the seat of the Earl of Ilchester, and the principal scene of
that charming story, <i>The First Countess of Wessex</i>, in the
collection of &ldquo;A Group of Noble Dames.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
great house of oddly diversified architecture, stands in the
midst of this nobly wooded and strikingly varied domain, but can
readily be seen, for the carriage-drive is a public right of
way.&nbsp; This is the broad roadway through the park described
in the passage where Tupcombe, riding towards &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Hintock Court&rdquo;&mdash;as Mr. Hardy disguises the identity of
the place&mdash;from Mells, on Squire Dornell&rsquo;s errand, saw
it stretching ahead &ldquo;like an unrolled deal
shaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Like
most of the stories of those noble dames, this romance of Betty
Dornell, the First Countess of Wessex, is founded upon actual
people, and largely upon their real doings.&nbsp; Squire Dornell
of Falls Park&mdash;really Mells Park&mdash;was in real life that
Thomas Horner who in 1713 married Susannah Strangways, heiress of
the Strangways family and owner of Melbury Sampford; and their
only child was Elizabeth, born in 1723, who in 1736, in her
thirteenth year, almost precisely as in the story, was married to
Stephen Fox, afterwards Earl of Ilchester, who died in
1776.&nbsp; The Countess died in 1792.</p>

<p>The father of the first Countess of Wessex was, it is curious
to know, descended from Little Jack Horner, that paragon of
selfishness who sat in a corner, eating his Christmas pie, and
who, the familiar nursery rhyme goes on to tell us,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Put in his thumb and pulled out a plum,<br
/>
And said, What a good boy am I!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nursery rhyme was that, and something more.&nbsp; It was,
in fact a satire upon that John Horner who, upon the dissolution
of the monasteries, purchased for much less than it was worth the
confiscated Mells estate of Glastonbury Abbey.&nbsp; This prize,
the &ldquo;plum&rdquo; of the rhyme, is said to have been worth
&pound;10,000.&nbsp; The Horners, represented by Sir John Horner,
espoused the side of the Parliament in the war with Charles I.
but they have kept their plum, at every hazard and in all
chances, and Mells Park is still in the family.</p>

<p>Leland tells how the house of Melbury Park was built in the
sixteenth century by Sir Giles Strangways, but portions of the
great T-shaped building have at later times been added, notably
the wing built in the time of Queen Anne.&nbsp; The whole
heterogeneous pile, dominated by a church-like, six-sided central
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>tower,
occupies a raised grassy site looking upon a lake on whose
opposite shore is the little manorial church of Melbury Sampford,
plentifully stored with monuments of Strangways and
Fox-Strangways, and in especial notable for that to the courtly
and equable husband of Betty Dornell.&nbsp; His epitaph, by the
hand of his widow, describes him as the most desirable of
husbands.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Near this stone is

</blockquote>
<p>At the other extremity of the park is the small and secluded
village of Melbury Osmund, the &ldquo;Little Hintock&rdquo; of
<i>The Woodlanders</i>, &ldquo;one of those sequestered spots
outside the gates of the world, where may usually be found more
meditation than action, and more listlessness than
meditation.&rdquo;&nbsp; It lies among vast hills and profound
hollows, whose huge convexities and corresponding concavities
render this a district to be more comfortably ridden by the
horseman than walked, and one to be explored by the cyclist only
with great and exhausting labour.</p>
<p>By perspiring perseverance, however, Yeovil and Somerset, or,
speaking by the card, &ldquo;Ivell&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outer
Wessex&rdquo; may be reached at last, by way of the
strangely-entitled village of Ryme Intrinsica, whose name, so
spelled on the map, is, with considerable incertitude both as to
spelling and meaning, said to be properly written
&ldquo;Entrenseca&rdquo; or &ldquo;Entrensicca.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Local theories, disregarding altogether the inexplicable
&ldquo;Ryme,&rdquo; and expending themselves upon the
preposterous Latinity of the second part of the name, have come
to some sort of agreement that it denotes a dry place on a ridge
placed between two watered vales; and those curious enough to
look for it on a large-scale map will perceive readily enough
that, whatever the comparative dryness of the ridge it does
occupy, it is certainly so flanked by the low-lying lands in
which flow two tributaries of the river Yeo.</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Hutchins, the county historian, on the other hand,
gives a wholly different explanation of the name.&nbsp; Spelling
the &ldquo;Intrinseca&rdquo; with an &ldquo;e,&rdquo; instead of
the final &ldquo;i,&rdquo; he says it is so called, Ryme
Intrinseca, or &ldquo;In Ryme,&rdquo; in contradistinction to an
outlying portion of the old manor, away down in the parish of
Long Bredy, and styled Ryme Extrinsecus, or &ldquo;Out
Ryme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At any rate, Ryme Intrinsica looks scarcely the place to be
dolled out in so classical a style.&nbsp; It is too Saxon, too
rustic and homespun in all its circumstances of thatch,
rickyards, dairies, and pigsties; and its little church is not in
any way corroborative of this dignity.</p>
<p>Yeovil, whose name has so bucolic a sound that it would seem
to be, above all other places, the home most suitable for yeomen,
is the &ldquo;Ivell&rdquo; of the Wessex novels, but finds only
scattered allusions in them, and touches far from intimate.&nbsp;
Cope, the curate, who in the story <i>For Conscience&rsquo;
Sake</i> married the conscience-smitten Millborne&rsquo;s
daughter when at last the father effaced himself, was curate at
Ivell; and it was at the &ldquo;Castle&rdquo; inn of the same
town that the brothers Halborough called for their drunken
father, in the harrowing embarrassments of <i>A Tragedy of two
Ambitions</i>, but those are the nearest approaches to be
discovered.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">SHERBORNE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> remains in pleasant Sherborne
to tell of that time when it was a cathedral city, and when,
after it had lost that high dignity, it was of scarce less
importance as the home of a powerful Abbey.&nbsp; It was the
pleasing, well-watered and sheltered situation, in the vale where
the little Yeo or Ivel runs&mdash;the stream which, passing
through Yeovil, gives that town its name&mdash;that first
attracted the religious in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
705, the time of that now misty and vague monarch, King
Ina.&nbsp; The Yeo had not yet obtained that name, and was merely
spoken of in descriptive and admiratory phrase as the <i>Seir
burne</i>, an Anglo-Saxon description for a bright and clear
brook which has crystallised here and at several other places in
the country, into a place-name.&nbsp; Even in the City of London
there is a Sherborne Lane, where no stream now flows, the
successor, however, of a pleasant lane, where in Anglo-Saxon
times a tributary of the Wall Brook flowed.</p>
<p>Not every one was satisfied with this choice for a cathedral
site.&nbsp; William of Malmesbury wrote of it as &ldquo;pleasant
neither by multitudes of inhabitants, nor beauty of
position.&rdquo;&nbsp; But beauty is a matter of individual
taste.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonderful, almost<b> </b><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>shameful,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;was it, that a
bishop&rsquo;s see should have remained here for so many
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; For three hundred and three years it so
remained, the bishop&rsquo;s seat being removed only in 1078,
when Old Sarum, a much more inconvenient site, sterile, cramped
and waterless&mdash;a place that to the Saxons was Searobyrig,
the dry city&mdash;was selected, only itself to be abandoned in
less than another hundred and fifty years.&nbsp; In the meanwhile
no fewer than twenty-seven bishops ruled in succession at
Sherborne and passed into the Great Beyond, leaving for the most
part, very little evidence of their existence.&nbsp; Notable
exceptions, however, were Adhelm, an early translator of the
Scriptures, and Asser, whose biography of his friend and patron,
Alfred the Great, is a monument to himself as well as to his
subject.&nbsp; In the choir-aisles of the existing Abbey-church
are sundry relics of those prelates, in the shape of ancient
tombs with battered effigies, as near a likeness to them as
possible for the sculptors to produce; and in the retro-choir are
pointed out the spots where Kings Ethelbald and Ethelbert,
brothers and predecessors of King Alfred, lie.</p>
<p>After an interval of uncertainty following the removal of the
bishopric in 1078 to Old Sarum, the cathedral here was in 1139
made a Benedictine Abbey and rebuilt by Roger, Bishop of Sarum,
who although he might not again remove the cathedral back to
Sherborne, seems to have loved the place, and certainly lavished
much care and labour upon it.</p>
<p>Bishop Roger was a man of energy and determination.&nbsp;
Starting in life as a poor Norman monk, <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>he owed his
first important preferment to a curious circumstance.&nbsp; None
could gabble through a mass more speedily than he, and he raced
through a service before Henry I. so quickly, while the king was
anxious to be off a-hunting, that the gratified monarch put him
on the broad high road to advancement, along whose course Roger
travelled far.&nbsp; But, if all had liked him as little as did
the censorious William of Malmesbury, his journeys would have
been short.&nbsp; To that chronicler he was &ldquo;unscrupulous,
fierce and avaricious,&rdquo; not content to keep his own, but
eager to grab the goods of others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was there
anything contiguous to his property which might be advantageous
to him, he would directly extort it, either by entreaty or
purchase, or, if that failed, by force.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must have
been well, therefore, to arrange terms with this masterful
personage while he was in the negotiating way, lest he took what
he wanted, without so much as a
&ldquo;by-your-leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; The great Norman structure he
erected has largely survived, not only in its ground plan, but in
the essential circumstances of its walling, for although it is
outwardly a building in the Perpendicular phase of Gothic, dating
from the second half of the fifteenth century, that
magnificently-elaborated external show of nave and presbytery is
but a later and more enriched surface, daringly grafted upon the
stern and solemn Norman walls of over three hundred years&rsquo;
earlier date.</p>
<p>The history of the great Benedictine Abbey of Sherborne very
clearly retells the old tale of Bury St. Edmunds, of Norwich, and
of many another great monastic centre, by which you see that
these <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>rich and powerful settlements of the religious were not
generally at peace with the outside worldlings.&nbsp; The causes
of quarrel were many.&nbsp; In some places the monastery was a
harsh and exacting landlord; in others the imposts and hindrances
placed upon the markets, whose tolls in many instances were the
property of the Church, aroused bitter enmity and constant
strife; and in yet more cases the maintenance of forests and game
for the sport of the Lords Abbots gave rise to trouble.&nbsp;
Poachers we have had always with us, and even in those times when
to kill the stag in the Chases was a crime adjudged worthy death
or mutilation, men for sport or sustenance illegally slew the
game.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall he have who killed the
deer?&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, an ear cut off or a nose slit, at the
very least of it.</p>
<p>Here at Sherborne the bitterest quarrel arose from other
causes.&nbsp; It seems that the parish church was situated at the
west end of the Abbey, separated from it only by a door which the
monks, exclusives always, had sought gradually to narrow, with a
view of eventually blocking it up altogether.&nbsp; A question
nearly allied with this was whether the children of the townsfolk
should be baptised in the Abbey or in the parish church, and the
disputes at last grew so raw that the Sherborne burgesses, very
wrothy and spiteful, took to ringing their church-bells so long
and so loudly that on account of the clamour, the monastic
offices could not be carried on.&nbsp; In 1437 the points at
issue were by common consent laid before the Bishop of Salisbury,
who, siding with his own cloth, made an award in favour of the
Abbey.&nbsp; Regarding this decision as an <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>injustice,
the townsfolk refused to abide by it; but there were evidently
two parties in the town, for one faction, headed by a stalwart
butcher, broke into the parish church with some of the monks and
reduced the font to fragments.&nbsp; Things then, naturally grew
worse, until, as Leland puts it, &ldquo;The variance grew to a
plain sedition, until a priest of the town church of All Hallows
shot a shaft with fire into the top of that part of the Abbey
Church of St. Mary that divided the east part that the monks used
from that the townsmen used; and this partition happening at the
time to be thatched in, the roof was set on fire, and
consequently the whole church, the lead and bells melted, was
defaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Choir was so seriously injured that it was taken down and
rebuilt, but the rest was repaired, and still in some parts shows
traces, in the reddened patches on the beautiful golden-yellow
Ham Hill sandstone of the internal walls, of the
conflagration.</p>
<p>The townsfolk were made to contribute heavily to the cost of
repair and rebuilding; works resulting in a more lovely interior,
both in form and colour, than owned by any other considerable
church in the west.&nbsp; A commonplace person, one no
connoisseur of churches, if asked to convey a general sense of
their interiors by the medium of temperature would reply that
they were cold, for coldness is the effect most often
produced&mdash;irrespective of the degrees registered by the
thermometer&mdash;by their stonework; but here, though the
mercury shrink down from the tube into close proximity with the
bulb, provocative in most places of shivers, even the most
matter-of-fact, irresponsive to the call of soaring arches, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>painted
windows and delicately poised fretted roof to &ldquo;lift up your
hearts, O Zion!&rdquo; feel a grateful sensation of warmth
pervading them, apparently radiating from these walls of richly
hued stone, whose natural colouring seems to fully furnish the
place and render it indifferent to the rigours of the
season.&nbsp; It is a colour compact of all the beautiful hues of
this country of a rich and bountiful Nature: of honey, of apples
and pears golden and russet, of autumn leaves, and of cider and
October ale, with a glint of the sun through it all.&nbsp; It
gives a beautiful and cheerful tone, quick to purge melancholy
and to make the devout happier in their hallelujahs than when in
the cold, if chaste, companionship of Portland stone, the mild
cream purity of the oolite of Bath, the Gregorian richness of the
building stone of Mansfield, or the solemn satisfaction
engendered by the deep red sandstone of Devon.</p>
<p>The exquisite fan-vaulting of Sherborne Abbey, the finest
example of that supremest effort of the last stage of Gothic art,
has no superior elsewhere.&nbsp; That of Henry VII.&rsquo;s
Chapel at Westminster, and that in St. George&rsquo;s Chapel at
Windsor, are on a larger scale, and more daring, but, although
generally cited as representative, are not so truly artistic.</p>
<p>The old Pack-Monday fair, still an annual institution at
Sherborne, is a two days&rsquo; market, originating with the
completion of the repairs and the vaulting of the nave, under
Abbot Peter de Ramsam, or Rampisham, in 1504.&nbsp; Tradition has
it that, the last stone well and truly laid and the great church
at last again in order, the masons and their <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>kind were
paid off and bidden depart by midnight on the Sunday after Old
Michaelmas Day.&nbsp; Accordingly, Pack-Monday fair is opened
every year at the stroke of midnight on the Sunday succeeding
October 10th, to the accompaniment of a din of horn-blowing and
the uncouth banging of tin cans.</p>
<p>Much of the beauty of the Abbey interior is due to the loving
care of the restoration executed by the Digbys of Sherborne
Castle, between 1848 and 1858, at a cost of over
&pound;32,000.&nbsp; The church of All Hallows at the west end,
which caused all the trouble, was demolished after the
dissolution of the monastery, when the Abbey was sold to the town
for use as a parish church and All Hallows itself thereby became
a redundancy.&nbsp; Its situation and its ground-plan can still
be traced on the paths and lawns and on the ragged walls and
makeshift patchwork that serve as West Front to the Abbey.</p>
<p>An ancestor of the restoring Digbys is commemorated by a
pretentious mountain of marble in the south transept, with an
epitaph, written by a bishop, setting forth with much
antithetical rhodomontade his many virtues of activities and
renunciations:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here Lyes John, Lord Digby, Baron Digby of Sherborne
and Earl of Briftol.&nbsp; Titles to which ye merit of his
Grandfather firft gave luftre And which he himfelf laid down
unfully&rsquo;d.&nbsp; He was naturally enclined to avoid the
Hurry of a publick Life, Yet carefull to keep up the port of his
Quality.&nbsp; Was willing to be at eafe, but fcorned
obfcurity.&nbsp; And therefore never made his retirement a
pretence to draw Himfelf within a narrower <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>compafs, or
to fhun fuch expence As Charity, Hospitality and his Honour
call&rsquo;d for.&nbsp; His Religion was that which by <span
class="smcap">Law</span> is Eftablisfhed, and the Conduct of his
life fhew&rsquo;d the power of it in his Heart.&nbsp; His
distinction from others never made him forget himfelf or
them.&nbsp; He was kind and obliging to his Neighbours, generous
and condefcending to his inferiours, and juft to all
Mankind.&nbsp; Nor had the temptations of honour and pleafure in
this world Strength enough to withdraw his Eyes from that great
Object of his hope, which we reafonably affure ourfelves he now
enjoys.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The surroundings of the Abbey closely resemble cathedral
precincts, and lead the well-informed stranger to remember that
Sherborne cherishes hopes of some day being again erected into
the head of a bishop&rsquo;s see, when that talked-of formation
of a new diocese, carved out of the great territorial domains of
Salisbury and of Bath and Wells, shall be an accomplished
fact.</p>
<p>The usual and properest way of coming to the Abbey, after you
have glimpsed the fine picture it makes looking down Long Street,
is past the Conduit&mdash;usually called the Monks&rsquo;
Conduit&mdash;standing on the pavement of Cheap Street, and
through a time-worn archway and a narrow alley of small shops and
old houses.&nbsp; The Conduit, built about 1360, an open
octangular building greatly resembling a market-cross, was
originally in the centre of the cloister-garth, to the north of
the Abbey, on a part of the site now occupied by the admirable
Grammar School, founded by <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Edward VI. from the spoils of the
dissolved monastery, and grown in these days to be one of the
foremost schools of the country.</p>
<p>Cheap Street, the principal thoroughfare of Sherborne, is,
like similar business streets in other West Country towns,
composed of houses of many periods and all sizes.&nbsp; It is
built generally of that sunny Ham Hill ferruginous sandstone,
quarried for many years at Stoke-sub-Hamdon, six miles to the
northwest of Yeovil.&nbsp; That fine old hostelry, the &ldquo;New
Inn,&rdquo; now swept away, was built of it.&nbsp; This vanished
house was the original of the &ldquo;Earl of Wessex,&rdquo; in
<i>The Woodlanders</i>, in whose yard Giles Winterborne is
observed by his old sweetheart from the balcony, while he is
engaged with the business of cider-making:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief hotel at Sherton Abbas was the &ldquo;Earl of
Wessex&rdquo;&mdash;a large stone-fronted inn with a yawning arch
under which vehicles were driven by stooping coachmen to back
premises of wonderful commodiousness.&nbsp; The windows to the
street were mullioned into narrow lights, and only commanded a
view of the opposite houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The castle, some distance outside the town to east, adjoining
the village of Castleton, was originally the combined palace and
fortress of the Bishops of Sherborne.&nbsp; The remaining
fragments, on their woody knoll overlooking the Yeo, in what is
now Sherborne Park, are those of the stout keep built by that
ambitious, and unscrupulous Bishop Roger, of Henry I.&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; Despite the curse, called down by the equally
ferocious and saintly Osmund, upon any who should dare to
alienate the castle from the bishops of Sherborne, it was wrested
from them <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>on several occasions, perhaps sometimes in direct
unbelieving challenge to that <i>quis separabit</i>; at others,
certainly, because, in the fashion of the times, the bishops had
taken part in the political troubles, the pitched battles and
weary sieges of contending factions, and, having the ill-luck to
side with the defeated party, suffered with them in body and
estate.&nbsp; For over two hundred years, from 1139 to 1355, it
was thus alienated, and Osmund&rsquo;s curse slept.&nbsp; Those
who owned the castle were not executed, or imprisoned, or made to
suffer beyond the usual medi&aelig;val average, perhaps because
it took no account of developments arising from mitred follies
and errors of judgment.&nbsp; At last, having been Crown property
for many generations, the stronghold and its surrounding lands
were granted to Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, from whom, after a
futile proposal had been made to fight him for it, in gage of
single combat&mdash;a fourteenth-century example of
Kingsley&rsquo;s &ldquo;muscular Christianity&rdquo;&mdash;it was
purchased by the bishop for 2,500 marks; a cheap lot.&nbsp;
Whether the earl, in Etonian phrase, &ldquo;funked it,&rdquo;
imagining the bishop&rsquo;s steel would be fellow to &ldquo;the
sword of the Lord and of Gideon,&rdquo; and as invincible, who
shall say?&nbsp; At any rate, Bishop Wyvil, this strenuous
champion, who feared neither the ordeal of the sword nor of the
purse, entered into the gates of his predecessors of old time,
and died here, after a residence of twenty years.&nbsp; The brass
to his memory, in the north-east transept of Salisbury Cathedral,
displays a representation of Sherborne Castle, with a figure of
the bishop&rsquo;s champion armed with a battle axe, by which it
will be seen that it was not scandalously, in his own proper
person, <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>that the bishop was prepared to fight, but by a deputy,
skilled in arms, and supported by the ghostly terrors of that
ancient curse.</p>
<p>And so, in the possession of the bishops of Salisbury who, to
all intents and purposes, and within the meaning of old Oswald,
were successors and representatives of the Bishops of Sherborne,
the castle remained until 1540, when, in the dissolution of
religious houses, it was seized and afterwards granted to the
Lord Protector, the Duke of Somerset.&nbsp; Then the curse seems
to have come into its own again, for Somerset ended, where many
other good and true were cut off, on Tower Hill.&nbsp; Although
subsequently restored to the bishop of Salisbury, it was again
alienated by Bishop Cotton to Sir Walter Raleigh, as payment for
favours and promotion received when that hero and courtier was in
the enjoyment of royal smiles.&nbsp; Raleigh, as every one knows,
ended tragically, after long-drawn misery, in 1618, on the same
spot where Somerset had suffered sixty years earlier.&nbsp; And
well, the superstitious may think, was it that by legal quirks
and quibbles James I. succeeded in chousing Raleigh&rsquo;s son
out of his inheritance, for the ill-omened possession continued
to work disaster.&nbsp; James bestowed it upon his favourite, the
despicable Robert Carl, Earl of Somerset, who, convicted of being
accessory to the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, was condemned to
die, but was reprieved, and finally released by the timid James,
to die obscurely in 1645.&nbsp; Something of a blundering curse,
this, one may think, to miss scoring a &ldquo;bull&rdquo; on so
admirable and easy a mark.</p>
<p>The king then conveyed the property to Digby, <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Earl of
Bristol, the &ldquo;Earl of Severn&rdquo; of the slight story of
<i>Anna</i>, <i>Lady Baxby</i>, in <i>A Group of Noble
Dames</i>.&nbsp; When the Civil War broke out, Sherborne Castle
was garrisoned for the king by the Marquis of Hertford, and early
besieged by the Earl of Bedford, on behalf of the
Parliament.&nbsp; It happened here&mdash;as so often it did in
their internecine strife&mdash;that there were relatives engaged
on either side in this siege.&nbsp; The Earl of Bristol&rsquo;s
son, George, Lord Digby, was married to the Lady Anne Russell,
sister of the Earl of Bedford.&nbsp; She it was, the &ldquo;Anna,
Lady Baxby,&rdquo; of the story, who rode out secretly to her
brother, and told him that if he were determined to reduce the
castle, he &ldquo;should find his sister&rsquo;s bones buried in
the ruins.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the investment continued until,
finding himself weaker than he had supposed, the marquis offered
to surrender on terms.&nbsp; If they were not accepted he
proposed, with the Lady Anne&rsquo;s consent, and indeed at her
wish, to station her on the battlements, and let the
enemy&rsquo;s marksmen do their worst.&nbsp; The Earl of Bedford
was not proof against this, and it is said, raising the siege,
retired.</p>
<p>But this plan would not always work.&nbsp; Three years later,
in 1645, when Sir Lewis Dives, the Earl of Bristol&rsquo;s
stepson, was in command, a greater than the Earl of Bedford
appeared before Sherborne Castle, and summoned it to
surrender.&nbsp; This was Sir Thomas Fairfax, flushed with his
successes, and making a clean sweep of the garrisons in the west
of England.&nbsp; For sixteen days, his forces sat down in front
of the castle, which then surrendered, with its garrison of
fifty-five gentlemen and six hundred soldiers.&nbsp; With that
surrender came the final ruin, <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>for the castle was
&ldquo;slighted,&rdquo; or destroyed by gunpowder, its contents
and the spoils of &ldquo;the lodge,&rdquo; sold to the people of
Sherborne.&nbsp; This &ldquo;Lodge&rdquo; was the mansion which
even then had been built near by, the castle already proving too
inconvenient for the ideas of those times.&nbsp; It is the
so-called &ldquo;Castle&rdquo; of to-day, still the seat of
Digbys, collateral and commoner descendants of the old
owners.&nbsp; Sir Walter Raleigh built the centre portion of it
in 1594, as his arms and the sculptured figures show, and Digbys
the later wings.&nbsp; Their crest, the singular one of an
ostrich holding a horse-shoe in its beak, is prominent over the
entrance to the courtyard.&nbsp; In the park is still shown a
stone seat, said to be that on which Sir Walter Raleigh was
resting and smoking his first pipe of tobacco, when his pipe was
dowsed and he drenched, by the pail of water thrown over him by
his faithful retainer, who, not unnaturally, as tobacco was then
a thing unknown, imagined his master to be on fire, and, in the
expressive words of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade&rsquo;s
reports, &ldquo;well alight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lodge, now the &ldquo;Castle,&rdquo; was a halting-place
of the Prince of Orange on his triumphal march from Tor Bay, in
1688.&nbsp; He slept here a night, and from a printing-press in
the house was issued his address to the people of England.</p>

191</span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">SHERBORNE TO CERNE
ABBAS AND WEYMOUTH</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is twenty-six miles from stately
Sherborne, the &ldquo;Sherton Abbas&rdquo; of <i>The
Woodlanders</i>, to where Weymouth sits enthroned on the margin
of her circular Bay, and, always supposing that no strong
southerly gale is blowing, there is for the cyclist no easier
route in all the Hardy Country.&nbsp; Bating the steep rise out
of Sherborne and out of the Vale of Blackmore to the chalk
uplands at Minterne Magna, it is a route of favourable gradients,
with one interval of dead level.</p>
<p>The river Yeo is a small stream, but its valley is deep and
wide, as he who, leaving Sherborne, climbs the hills which shut
in that valley, shall find.&nbsp; But a reward comes with the
easy descent to the long, scattered street of rustic cottages at
Long Burton, whence the way lies across a dead level to where,
six miles distant from this point, rise the bastions of the
mid-Dorset heights, seen distinctly from here: Dogbury, with his
convex clump of cresting trees, like a blue-black wig, High Stoy,
where the ridge runs bare, with Nettlecomb Tout and Bulbarrow in
the hazy distance.</p>
<p>It is a straight, and a marshy and low-lying, as well as a
flat road to Holnest, where, beside the <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>road, is
Holnest Lodge, belonging to the Erle-Drax family, and one of the
seats of that eccentric person, the late J. S. W. Sawbridge
Erle-Drax, of Charborough Park, long a member of Parliament for
Wareham, and one of the last of the squires.&nbsp; The old time
squires were laws to themselves, and like none others.&nbsp; The
product of generations of other many-acred squires of great
port-drinking propensities and unbounded local influence, whom
all the lickings administered at Eton did not suffice to bring to
a proper sense of their intrinsic unimportance, apart from the
accidental circumstance that they were the lords of their manors,
&ldquo;old Squire Drax,&rdquo; as the rustics call him now that
he is dead, might from his high-handed ways have <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>formed an
excellent model for a dramatist building up a melodrama of the
old style.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;the Squire&rdquo; to the very
<i>n</i>th degree, with so extraordinary an idea of his own
importance that here, on the lawn fronting Holnest Lodge, he
caused to be erected in his own lifetime a memorial to
himself.&nbsp; An inspection of the approach to that residence
will convince any one not only that he was very rich, but very
mad as well.&nbsp; The sweeping drive is bordered at intervals
with statues: Circes, Floras, Ceres, Dianas, and other classical
deities, shining whitely and conspicuously against the grass, and
leading the eye up to the central point where, on a tall imposing
column, guarded by crouching lions, stands the bronze,
frock-coated statue of Squire Drax himself.&nbsp; It is all very
like a kind of higher-class Rosherville, and exceedingly
curious.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>One has not progressed far along the dead-level road before
another evidence of the Drax swelled head comes in sight.&nbsp;
It is a huge building in the Byzantine style, highly elaborated,
and decorated in a costly way with polished stones.&nbsp; Its
purpose puzzling at first, it is seen on closer approach to stand
in a churchyard and to be a mausoleum.&nbsp; Away back from it
stands in perspective the little church of Holnest, scarce larger
than this gorgeous place prepared by the squire for his rest, and
looking really smaller.&nbsp; The rustics dot the i&rsquo;s and
cross the t&rsquo;s of his eccentricity, telling how he had his
coffin made in his lifetime and his funeral rehearsed in front of
the house.&nbsp; The more superstitious declare that the
mausoleum was built so strongly and substantially in order to
foil a certain personage whose desire is rather for the souls
than for the <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>bodies of his own; and, to support their dark beliefs,
narrate how, canvassing for votes during the progress of an
election the squire declared he had always been a Member of
Parliament, would always be, and would rather go to the Pit with
the initials of M.P. attached to his name than to Heaven without
them.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these wonder-mongers halt a little
short of the completeness desired by dramatic requirements, and
do not proceed to tell us how the election was secured by the
agency of a gentlemanly stranger of persuasive manners and
club-feet, who, upon the declaration of the poll mysteriously
disappeared amid a strong smell of Tandstick&ouml;r matches.</p>

<p>Advancing, we come at Middlemarsh into the <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>country of
<i>The Woodlanders</i>, where dense woodlands now begin to cover
the levels.&nbsp; The long ridge of the downs ahead now grows
stern, steep, and threatening.&nbsp; To the left hand an isolated
protuberance, covered with trees, the oddly named Dungeon Hill,
rises, disclosing from its flanks peeps into the Vale of
Blackmore, where the explorer can, with promptitude and thorough
efficacy, lose himself.&nbsp; Believe one who has been along the
sometimes devious and sometimes straight, but always lonely,
roads of these levels.&nbsp; There, down beyond Dungeon Hill and
Pulham, on a road flat as the alliterative flounder and empty as
a City church, stands at King&rsquo;s Stag Bridge across the
river Lidden an inn with the sign of the White Hart and a verse
alluding to the origin of the name <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>of &ldquo;Vale of White Hart&rdquo;
given to this part of the greater Vale of Blackmore&mdash;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The classic historian of Dorsetshire tells us something of the
story thus darkly reflected.&nbsp; According to his account,
corrected in details from other sources, it seems that King Henry
III. hunting in what was then a forest, rounded up, among several
other deer, a particularly beautiful white hart, whose life he
spared for future hunting.&nbsp; Somewhat later, Sir John de la
Lynde, Bailiff of Blackmore Forest, a neighbouring gentleman of
ancient descent and local importance, out hunting with a party,
roused the same animal, and, less pitiful than the king, killed
it at the end of a long pursuit, at the spot ever after called
King&rsquo;s Stag Bridge.&nbsp; The king, highly offended, not
only punished Sir John de la Lynde and his companions with
imprisonment and heavy fines, but taxed their lands severely and
permanently, so that for many later generations the fine of White
Hart Silver continued to be paid into the Exchequer.&nbsp;
Another historian, the quaint and amusing Fuller, in giving his
version, states that the whole county was laid under
contribution.&nbsp; &ldquo;Myself,&rdquo; he says whimsically
&ldquo;hath paid a share for the sauce who never tasted the
meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is stated that &ldquo;White Hart
Silver&rdquo; was levied until the reign of Henry VII.</p>
<p>The road, passing a signpost weirdly directing <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>to
&ldquo;Giant&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; ascends a steep hill, perhaps
the &lsquo;Rubdon Hill&rsquo; of <i>The Woodlanders</i>, and the
Lyon&rsquo;s Gate Hill of actual fact, down which, into the vale
on that autumnal day went Fitzpiers, the infatuated
surgeon&mdash;a Dorsetshire Tannh&auml;user, thinking of the
Venus who had bewitched him, and careless of the beauty of the
season&mdash;when &ldquo;the earth was now at the supreme moment
of her bounty.&nbsp; In the poorest spots the hedges were bowed
with haws and blackberries; acorns cracked underfoot, and the
burst husks of chestnuts lay exposing their auburn contents as if
arranged by anxious sellers for the market.&rdquo;&nbsp; Steeply
upward continues the hill, to the ridge of the mid-Dorset
heights, whence Blackmore Vale, of which it is very truly said
that &ldquo;an unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather,
is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and
miry ways,&rdquo; is seen spreading out like an unrolled map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which
the fields are never brown, and the springs never dry,&rdquo; is
bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the
prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout,
Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down.&nbsp; There &ldquo;in the
valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more
delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that
from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green
threads overspreading the paler green of the grass.&nbsp; The
atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with azure
that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that
hue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest
ultramarine.&nbsp; Arable lands <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>are few and limited; with but slight
exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees,
mantling minor hills and dales within the major.&nbsp; Such is
the Vale of Blackmore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The village of Minterne Magna that, with its fine trees and
the seat of Lord Digby, has so handsome a presence, is the
&ldquo;Great Hintock&rdquo; of <i>The Woodlanders</i>.&nbsp; Poor
loyal-hearted Giles Winterbourne, &ldquo;a good man, who did good
things,&rdquo; was buried here, beside that ivy-covered
church-tower overlooking the road, and now bearing the
inscription</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">LE TEMPS PASSE</span><br />

</blockquote>
<p>They laid him to rest &ldquo;on the top of that hill looking
down into the Vale,&rdquo; to whose villages he had, as autumn
came round, been wont to descend with his portable cider-mill and
press; and Grace rejoined her husband, and the world went on as
usual.&nbsp; Only Marty South remembered him and treasured his
memory.</p>
<p>At Minterne Magna, otherwise &ldquo;Great Hintock,&rdquo;
according to a rustic character, &ldquo;you do see the world and
life,&rdquo; whereas, at Little Hintock, to be identified with
Melbury Osmund, away down at Evershot, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis such a
small place that you&rsquo;d need a candle and lantern to find
it, if ye don&rsquo;t know where &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, at the same time, outside the pages of novels Minterne
Magna is not a place of stir and movement, and is great only in
name.</p>
<p>From just before Minterne Magna there is a <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>left-hand
turning which affords an alternative route to Dorchester,
avoiding Cerne Abbas, and going exposedly over the haggard
downs.&nbsp; The two routes are locally known as the overhill and
the underhill roads.&nbsp; The first-named is now little
travelled, and its old house of entertainment, the Revels inn, a
thing of the past.&nbsp; This, &ldquo;the forsaken coach-road
running in an almost meridional line from Bristol to the south
shore of England,&rdquo; is the route of the escaped prisoner and
the scene of &ldquo;Higher Crowstairs&rdquo; in the intense story
of <i>The Three Strangers</i>.&nbsp; On that route you see better
than anywhere else, those &ldquo;calcareous downs&rdquo;
described by the novelist, where &ldquo;the hills are open, the
sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed
character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low
and splashed, the atmosphere colourless.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, by
the same token, of an exhausting dryness in summer, and in winter
only to be undertaken by the most robust.</p>
<p>By the &lsquo;underhill&rsquo; road on the other hand, the ten
miles from Minterne to Dorchester are chiefly on a gentle
descent.&nbsp; Presently, therefore, one reaches Cerne Abbas, the
&ldquo;Abbot&rsquo;s Cernel&rdquo; of <i>Tess</i> and other
stories, situated in a fine widening of the valley through which
the river Cerne flows, with the gaunt bare shoulders of the great
chalk downs receding far enough to lose something of their
asperity, and to gain in distance all the atmosphere and softened
outlines of an impressionistic picture.&nbsp; From the south,
half a mile beyond the decayed town of Cerne, a very beautiful
view of this nature opens out, by the roadside.&nbsp; There the
fine tower of the church stands out against the sage-green <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>coloration
of the hills, and with the luxuriant trees and the nestling farms
of the valley, presents by force of contrast with the bare
uplands a striking picture of comfort, prosperity, and
hospitality, not perhaps warranted in every one of those respects
by a closer acquaintance.&nbsp; For Cerne is a place very hardly
treated by heartless circumstance.</p>
<p>Many centuries ago, in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 987
to be exact, a Benedictine Abbey was founded here by Ethelmar,
Earl of Devon and Cornwall, upon the site of a hermitage
established by &AElig;dwold, brother of that East Anglican saint,
Edmund the King and Martyr.&nbsp; It does not appear what became
of the hermit, whether those who established the abbey bought him
out, or threw him out; but it certainly seems to demand enquiry,
the more especially that hermits and abbots, pious founders and
holy monks were not altogether so unbusinesslike in their worldly
affairs as the uninstructed might imagine.&nbsp; The hermit
probably received due compensation for disturbance and went off
somewhere else.&nbsp; However that may be, the abbey grew and
flourished.&nbsp; Canute certainly despoiled it, but more than
made amends, by large gifts and endowments of other
people&rsquo;s property, when he had been brought to see the
error of his ways and that plundering&mdash;plundering the
property of the church, at least&mdash;was wrong.&nbsp; And so
the business of the abbey progressed through the centuries, to
the daily accompaniment of the monks chanting &ldquo;their
wonderful piff-and-paff&rdquo; as the librettist of <i>The Golden
Legend</i> makes the devil say of it.</p>
<p>In 1471 Henry VI.&rsquo;s Queen, Margaret of Anjou, striving
desperately, brave heart, on her son&rsquo;s behalf, fled for
shelter here, up the road from Weymouth, <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>where she
had landed from France; but, indeed, little else of history
belongs to this sometime rich and splendid abbey in the heart of
the hills.&nbsp; It afforded shelter and protection to the
townlet of Cerne that had sprung up outside its precincts; and
great therefore was the dismay when ruin overtook it in the time
of Henry VIII.&nbsp; The abbey disestablished, the town of course
also suffered.&nbsp; How greatly we do not know; but it plucked
up courage again and refused to die, and when England was still
that exceedingly uncomfortable England of coaching times,
flourished in a modest way on the needs of travellers for succour
and shelter on the exhausting journeys that are so romantic to
read of in Christmas numbers, but were the terror of those who
could not possibly stop at home.</p>

at last the coaches ceased and railways came to the country in
general, but not to Cerne.&nbsp; It is still, to-day, remote from
railways and is thus hit several severe, separate, and distinct
blows by Fate, which, when travellers no longer needed its
shelter, took away its chief reason for existence, refused it the
reinvigorating boon of a railway, and then, in the general
depression of agriculture, has dealt a final and staggering
buffet.&nbsp; Cerne is dead.&nbsp; There is (assuming for the
moment positive, comparative, and superlative degrees of
deadness) no deader townlet in England, and it has all the
interest, and commands all the respect due to the departed.&nbsp;
<i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>, and if there were hard things
to be said of Cerne, they should not here be uttered.&nbsp; But
there are no such things for utterance.&nbsp; It has all the
romance of the bygone that appeals to the artist, and I love to
dwell upon and in it.&nbsp; It is a place where commercialism
has, or should have, no part, and therefore, when I pass a
noble-looking farmhouse and a somewhat stately landlady comes out
with a key, asking me&mdash;with an eye upon the perquisite of
the fee exacted&mdash;if I would like to see the Abbey Gatehouse,
I refuse; earning thereby the keen contempt shown on her
expressive face.&nbsp; Soulless Goth, to wander about Cerne and
not see the Gatehouse!&nbsp; Ah! my dear lady, your contempt is
misplaced.&nbsp; I love these things better than you imagine, but
I hate commercialism&mdash;and in such unexpected
places&mdash;the more.&nbsp; The abbey ruins, wholly summed up in
that Gatehouse, are at the extremity of this dead town, but there
is a fine parish church in the centre of its streets.&nbsp; A
noble, highly decorated tower is that <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>belonging to it, one of the finest
productions of the Perpendicular period, with bold gargoyles,
whose gaping mouths are for the most part stopped with
birds&rsquo; nests.&nbsp; Decay and ruin squat next door, in the
shape of one of Cerne&rsquo;s wrecked and unroofed houses, so
long in that condition as to have become a terrace on which wild
flowers luxuriantly grow and display themselves to passing
admiration.&nbsp; It will be observed that there are
shops&mdash;or things in the specious and illusory shape of
shops&mdash;in this town of Yester-year.&nbsp; They indeed were
so once, but the shopkeepers have long ceased from their
shopkeeping.&nbsp; The windows, perhaps retained over against
that time when Cerne shall be resurrected&mdash;for
Fortune&rsquo;s wheel still spins, and will come full circle some
day&mdash;are meanwhile excellent for displaying geraniums.</p>

</a>Prominent in most views of Cerne Abbas is that weird figure
of a man on the hillside which gives an alternative name to
Trendle or Giant&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Giant of
Cerne&rdquo; is a big fellow, well deserving his name, for he is
180 feet high.&nbsp; No one knows who cut him on the chalk of the
hillside, but local tradition has long told how the figure
commemorated the destruction of a giant who, feasting on the
sheep of Blackmore, laid himself down here, in the sleep of
repletion, and was then, like another Gulliver, pinioned where he
lay by the enraged <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>peasantry, who killed him and immediately traced his
dimensions for the information of posterity.&nbsp; The prominence
of his ribs, however, says little for the result of his
feeding.</p>
<p>A more instructed opinion is that the figure represents Heil,
a god of the pagan Saxons, and that it was cut before <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 600.&nbsp; Fearful legends belong to
it: tales of horror narrating how the border enclosing the effigy
is the ground plan of a stout wicker-work cage in which the pagan
priests imprisoned many victims, whom they offered up as burnt
sacrifices to their god.</p>
<p>Looked upon with awe and wonder by the peasantry of old, who
cleaned him once every seven years, the Giant is now regarded by
them with indifference and left alone, and it is only the
stranger who finds himself obsessed with a strange awe as he
gazes upon this mystic relic of a prehistoric age.&nbsp; His
minatory and uncouth appearance&mdash;for the relation of his
head to his body is that of a pea to a melon&mdash;perhaps even
more than his size, impresses the beholder.&nbsp; It should be
said that he is merely traced in outline on the turf, in lines
two feet broad and one foot deep, and not laid bare, a huge white
shape, to the sky.&nbsp; The club he wields is 120 feet long, and
from seven to twenty-four feet broad.</p>

(<i>continued</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Past</span> Nether Cerne and Godmanstone,
the road leads, consistently straight and on a down gradient, to
Charminster, where, in consonance with the place-name, a
minster-like church stands.&nbsp; It is rich in monuments of the
Trenchards&mdash;bearing their motto, <i>Nosce Teipsum</i>, Know
Thyself&mdash;of the neighbouring historic mansion of Wolveton,
one of whom&mdash;a Sir Thomas&mdash;built the tower, in or about
the year 1500, as duly attested on the building itself, which
displays his cypher of two T&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Wolveton, standing in the rich level water-meadows where the
rivers Cerne and Frome come to a confluence, is, as the Man of
Family narrates in the story of <i>The Lady Penelope</i>, in <i>A
Group of Noble Dames</i>, &ldquo;an ivied manor-house, flanked by
battlemented towers, and more than usually distinguished by the
size of its mullioned windows.&nbsp; Though still of good
capacity, the building is much reduced from its original grand
proportions; it has, moreover, been shorn of the fair estate
which once appertained to its lord, with the exception of a few
acres of park-land immediately around the mansion.&nbsp; <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>This was
formerly the seat of the ancient and knightly Drenghards, or
Drenkhards, now extinct in the male line, whose name, according
to the local chronicles, was interpreted to mean <i>Strenuus

family were averse to the latter signification, and a duel was
fought by one of them on that account, as is well

<p>The Lady Penelope, who jestingly promised to marry all three

Fate ordained that her words should come true, was an actual

<p>For the distance of close upon a mile this Roman road, the
chief means of communication between their seaport station of
Clavinium, near Weymouth, and their inland town of Durnovaria,
runs on the level, bordered by the fine full-grown elms of one of
Dorchester&rsquo;s many avenues.&nbsp; Then it sets out with a
grim straightness to climb to the summit of that geological
spine, the Ridgeway, which places so stubborn an obstacle on
these nine miles of road that many a faint-hearted pilgrim from
Dorchester fails to reach Weymouth, and many another from
Weymouth gives up the task at less than half-way.</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>Climbing here, the vast mass of Maiden Castle rises on
the right, conferring a solemnity upon the scene, due not so much
to the bulk given it by nature as to the amazing ditches, mounds,
scarps, and counterscarps terraced along its mighty bosom
by&mdash;ay, by whom?&nbsp; Many peoples had a hand in the making
of this great fortification.&nbsp; The British Durotriges are
said to have styled it &ldquo;Mai-Dun,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Castle
of the great Hill,&rdquo; and to have established their capital
here; and at a later date the Romans camped upon it and must have
cursed the Imperialism which brought them here to wilt and wither
in face of the bitter blasts of an inclement land.</p>
<p>It was the Dunium of Ptolemy, and has been the wonder of many
ages, not easily able to understand by what enormous expenditure
of effort all these great mounds were heaped up and what enemies
they feared who delved the ditches so deeply and ramped the
ridges so steeply and so high.</p>
<p>Maiden Castle is still occupied, although the last defender
left it perhaps a thousand years ago; for as the curious
traveller to these prehistoric earthworks climbs exhaustedly up
the steep rises, over the short grass, he may see the rabbits
mounting guard by thousands against the skyline, or fleeing
panic-stricken, in admirable open order, showing myriads of white
flags formed by their tails as they go loping away over the
field.</p>

<p>As one progresses, more and more slowly with the acuter
gradient, up the roadway, the church-tower of Winterborne
Monkton, among its encircling barns, ricks, and cow-byres, comes
into view, <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>the observer&rsquo;s eye on a higher level than the
rooftop.&nbsp; Village there is none, and the clergyman who on
Sundays conducts services here must do so&mdash;between the peals
of the organ, and in midst of the quieter-spoken passages of
morning and evening prayers&mdash;to the commentatory lowing of
cattle or the grunts of pigs, sounding like the observations of
grudging critics.&nbsp; There was once a saint who, like a broody
hen that will nurse strange things, preached to the fowls of the
air and the beasts of the field, and the spiritual shepherd of
Winterborne Monkton not infrequently has among his congregation a
barn owl, and a cheerful concourse of sparrows in the roof, much
given to brawling in church.</p>
<p>Roman directness was all very well, but later races found it
much too trying for their horses, and thus we find, nearing the
summit, that the straight ancient road across the ridgeway has
long been abandoned, except by the telegraph-poles, for a cutting
through the crest and an S curve down the southern and much
steeper side.&nbsp; This expedient certainly eases both ascent
and descent, but it does not suffice to render the way less than
extremely fatiguing to climb and nerve-shaking to descend.</p>
<p>As a view-point it has remarkable features, for the whole
expanse of Portland Roads, the Isle of Portland, and the site on
which Weymouth and Melcombe Regis are built are exposed to gaze,
very much as though the spectator looking down upon them were
bending in an examination of some modelled map of physical
geography.&nbsp; White spires at Weymouth and equally white
groups of houses at Portland gain striking effects from
backgrounds of grey rock or the dark green of trees, massed by <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>distance to
the likeness of dense forests; and the mile-lengths of harbour
walls and breakwaters, punctuated with forts, out in the
roadstead are shrunken by distance to the likeness of a cast
seine-net supported by cork floats.&nbsp; On a ridge inland a row
of circular ricks with peaked roofs showing against the sea looks
absurdly like beehives, and down there in the middle distance is
the curving line of embankment where the railway from Dorchester
goes, after piercing the hill on which we stand by the Bincombe
Tunnel.</p>

<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>Descending the hill, we come to the valley of the
Wey.&nbsp; The older part of the village of Upwey marks the
source of that little stream to the right, and the newer part,
with the village of Broadwey, are scarcely to be distinguished
from one another, ahead.&nbsp; The original Upwey, the Upwey of
the &ldquo;Wishing Well,&rdquo; lies under the flanks of a great
down, where, if you climb and climb and continue climbing, you
will presently discover the poppy-like scarlet buildings of the
Weymouth waterworks.&nbsp; But there is no need to seek them
while the Wishing Well, nearer to hand, calls.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Wishing Well&rdquo; is a pretty spot, overhung with
trees and still a place resorted to by tourists, who either
shamefacedly, with an implied half-belief in its virtues, drink
its waters, or else with the quip and jest of unbelief, defer the
slaking of their thirst until the nearest inn is reached, where
liquors more palatable to the sophisticated taste&mdash;or what
Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s rustics would term &ldquo;a cup of
genuine&rdquo;&mdash;are obtainable.&nbsp; Once the haunt of
gipsies, who used the well as a convenient pitch, and, when you
crossed their palms with silver in the approved style, prophesied
fulfilment of the nicest things you could possibly wish
yourself&mdash;and a good many other things that would never
occur to you at all&mdash;it is now quite unexploited, save
perhaps by a little village girl, who, with a glass tumbler, will
save the devotee from stooping on hands and knees and lapping up
the magic water, like a dog.&nbsp; The gipsies have been all
frightened away by the Vagrants Act, and no great loss to the
community in general.&nbsp; The inquisitive stranger, curious to
know whether the villagers themselves <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>resort to their famous Fount of
Heart&rsquo;s Desire, receives a rude shock when he is told by
one of them that, &ldquo;Bless &rsquo;ee, there baint a

Mebbe &rsquo;tis good ver a whist (a stye) but all them

Age of Faith is dead.</p>
<p>And so into Weymouth, down a road lined with long rows of
suburbs.&nbsp; Radipole is come to this complexion at last, and
its spa is, like a service rendered and a benefit conferred, a
thing clean forgot.</p>

214</span>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WEYMOUTH</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, then, here, reaching a Modern
church with a tall spire, surrounded by suburban villas, is the
beginning of Weymouth.&nbsp; The sea in these miles has dropped
gradually down, out of sight as the road comes to the level, and
at this point you might, to all intents and purposes, be at North
Kensington, which the spot greatly resembles.&nbsp; But turning
sharply with the road to the right the derogatory illusion is at
once dispelled, for the sea is out there, sparkling, to the left;
and, in the perfect segment of a circle, the Esplanade of
Weymouth goes sweeping round to the harbour, with the Nothe Point
fort above, and, away out in the distance, that towering knob of
limestone, the Isle of Portland.&nbsp; It is a stimulating view,
and has generally other and even more stimulating constituents
than those of nature, for Weymouth and Portland are places of
arms, and the ships of the Navy are usually represented by a
squadron of cruisers well in shore, with a brace or two of
battleships coming, going, or anchored easily in sight, and
numbers of those ugly, imp-like craft, torpedo-boats, flying
hither and thither.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>Weymouth styles itself&mdash;or others style
it&mdash;&ldquo;the Naples of England,&rdquo; but no one has ever
yet found Naples returning the compliment and calling itself
&ldquo;the Weymouth of Italy.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is really no
reason why Weymouth, instead of seeking some fanciful resemblance
based solely, it may be supposed on the configuration of its
widely curving bay, should not stand or fall by the sufficing
attractions of its own charming self.&nbsp; For one thing, it
would be impossible to persuade the public that Weymouth owns a
Vesuvius somewhere away in its <i>hinterland</i>, and, although
the country is rich in Roman camps, no antiquary has yet
discovered a Pompeii midway between Melcombe Regis and
Dorchester.</p>
<p>The town is still in essentials the Weymouth of George III.,
the &ldquo;Budmouth&rdquo; of Thomas Hardy.&nbsp; They are, it is
true, the battleships of Edward VII. wallowing out there, like
fat pigs, where of yore the wooden men-o&rsquo;-war swam the
waters like swans; but the houses at least, that face the
Esplanade in one almost unbroken row, each one like its neighbour
and all absolutely innocent either of taste or pretension, are
characteristically Georgian.&nbsp; Taken individually and
examined, one might go greater lengths, and say such a house was
more than insipid and commonplace&mdash;was, indeed, downright
ugly&mdash;but in a long curving row the effect is a
comprehensive one of dignified restraint.&nbsp; At any rate, they
are constructed of good honest dull red brick, and not plastered
and made to look like stone.&nbsp; This bluff honesty in these
days of shams and of restless, worried-looking designs, when
every new building must have its own ready-made picturesqueness,
and this total absence of <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>anything and everything that by
remotest chance could be thought an ornament, is grateful.</p>
<p>We speak of this as &ldquo;Weymouth,&rdquo; but it is rather,
to speak by the card, Melcombe Regis, and although the interests
of both this and of Weymouth proper, on the other side of the
narrow neck of harbour, are now pooled, it was once a sign of
ignorance and a certain offence not to carefully distinguish
between the two.&nbsp; Their rivalries and jealousies were of old
so bitter that the river-mouth and harbour, long since bridged to
make a continuous street, was like a stream set between two alien
states.&nbsp; The passage was then &ldquo;by a bote and a rope
bent over ye haven, so y<sup>t</sup> in ye fery bote they use no
ores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These disputes and contentions had risen almost to the
condition of a smouldering petty local warfare in the time of
Queen Elizabeth, when means were taken to put an end to it.&nbsp;
Thus in 1571 they were compelled to unite, and in the familiar
phrase of fairy tales have &ldquo;lived happily ever
after.&rdquo;&nbsp; Says Camden: &ldquo;These stood both some
time proudlie upon their owne severall priviledges, and were in
emulation one of the other, but now, tho&rsquo; (God turne it to
the good of both!) many, they are, by authoritie of Parliament,
incorporated into one bodie, conjoyned by late by a bridge, and
growne very much greater and goodlier in buildings and by sea
adventures than heretofore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But things widely different from trade have in later times
made the fortune of the conjoined towns of Weymouth and Melcombe
Regis.&nbsp; I suppose the one or the other of them was bound in
the course of time to be &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; as a
bathing-resort, <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>but it is to George III. that Weymouth owes a deep debt
of gratitude.&nbsp; His son had already &ldquo;discovered&rdquo;
Brighthelmstone, or rather, had placed the seal of his approval
upon Dr. Russel&rsquo;s earlier discovery of it; and likewise
Weymouth was already on the road to recognition when George III.
came here first, in 1789.&nbsp; Thirty years or so earlier, when
people had begun as a strange new experience, to bathe, the sands
of Weymouth&mdash;or to adopt an attitude of strict correctitude,
the sands of Melcombe Regis&mdash;were on the way to
appreciation.&nbsp; Then greater folks lending their august
patronage where that of meaner people had little weight, the
place was resorted to by the famous Ralph Allen of Bath, for whom
in 1763 the first bathing-machine was constructed, and by a
stream of visitors gradually ascending in the social scale.&nbsp;
The place long found favour with the Duke of Gloucester, by whose
recommendation the king was induced to make a visit and then a
lengthy stay, placing the apex at last upon this imposing pyramid
of good fortune.&nbsp; It was no fleeting glimpse of royal favour
thus accorded, for with the coming of summer the king for many
years resided here at Gloucester Lodge, the mansion facing the
sea built by his brother the Duke of Gloucester, and now the
staid and grave Gloucester Hotel.&nbsp; Weymouth basked happily
in the splendours of that time.&nbsp; They were splendours of the
respectable domestic sort generally associated with that homely
monarch, who bathed from his machine in full view of his loyal
lieges and then went home to boiled mutton and turnips.&nbsp; He
made sober holiday on the Dorset coast while his graceless son
was on the coast of Sussex rearing a <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>fantastical palace and playing
pranks fully matching it in extravagance of design and purse.</p>
<p>Weymouth&rsquo;s return for all these favours is still to be
seen, in the bronze group erected by the townsfolk in 1809, to
celebrate the generally joyful occasion of his Jubilee, to
perpetuate the especial gratitude of the people for favours
received, and in hopes of more to come.</p>
<p>Weymouth very closely reflects the prosperity of that great
era, in the Georgian streets, the quaintly bowed windows of
private houses and the now old-world shop-fronts, many of them
exquisite examples of the restrained taste and aptitude for just
proportion in design characteristic of that age, and only now
beginning to be appreciated at their true worth.&nbsp; It was the
age of the Adams brothers, of Chippendale and Sheraton; an age
rightly come to be regarded in our time as classic in all things
in the domain of architecture and decoration.&nbsp; In its
unaltered purlieus Weymouth is thus singularly like the older
parts of Brighton, but now richer in vestiges of the Georgian
period than the larger and more changeful town.</p>
<p>That, doubtless, was a period of inflated prices in
Weymouth.&nbsp; King, queen, and princesses, fashionables and
many soldiers sent up the ideas of tradesfolk just as the sun
expands the mercury of a thermometer.&nbsp; Uncle Benjy, in
<i>The Trumpet Major</i>, found Budmouth a place where money flew
away doubly as quick as it did when the famous Scot visited
London and &ldquo;hadna&rsquo; been there a day when bang went
saxpence.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Budmouth in the time of Farmer George,
it was a &ldquo;shilling for this and a shilling for that; if you
only eat one egg or even a poor windfall of an apple,
you&rsquo;ve got to pay; and <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>a bunch o&rsquo; radishes is a
halfpenny, and a quart o&rsquo; cider a good tuppence
three-farthings at lowest reckoning.&nbsp; Nothing without
paying!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay! but if prices were no higher than these,
&rsquo;twas no such ruinous place, after all.&nbsp; Poor Uncle
Benjy!</p>

</a></p>
<p>The most striking differences in physical geography between
the constituent parts of Weymouth are that Melcombe Regis, here
on the shore is flat as a pancake, and Weymouth, there on
t&rsquo;other side of the harbour, is as hilly as a
house-roof.&nbsp; You could have no greater dissimilarity than
that between the prudish formality which stands for the Melcombe
front and the heaped-up terraces of houses of every description
at Weymouth, which has no front at all; unless indeed the lowest
tier of houses skirting the harbour and its quays, and looking
into the back alleys and quays of Melcombe may so be
styled.&nbsp; In those old days, to which Weymouth dates back, no
seaside town could afford so assailable a luxury as a
&ldquo;front,&rdquo; and the older quarters of nearly all such
are generally found, as here, folded away under the lee of a
bluff, or thinly lining the shores of an estuarial harbour.&nbsp;
Here the Nothe Point, with its fort mounted with heavy guns, is
the rocky bluff behind which the old town cowered from elemental
and human foes, and that estuary, both by reason of its narrow
entrance, and those great forts of the Nothe and Portland, has
never been one sought by an enemy&rsquo;s ship.</p>
<p>The harbour is not uninteresting: what harbour ever is?&nbsp;
The comings and goings of ships have their own romance, and bring
rumours of all kinds of outer worlds and strange peoples.&nbsp;
You look across from the quays of Weymouth to the quays <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>of
Melcombe, and there, beside the walls and the old warehouses, lie
the ships from many home and foreign ports, their names duly to
be read under their counters.&nbsp; Whence they individually
come, I do not greatly care to know.&nbsp; This one may only have
come from the Channel Islands with a consignment of early
potatoes: and, on the other hand, it may have won home again
after who knows what romantic doings at the Equator or within the
Arctic Zone.&nbsp; It may have brought treasure-trove, or on the
other hand be merely carrying ordinary commercial freights, at so
low a figure that the owners are dissatisfied and the skipper
gloomy.&nbsp; It is well, you see, to leave a little margin for
fancy when the good ship has come to port once more and within
sight and the easiest reach of those two great features of a
Christian and a civilised land: the Church and the Public
House.</p>
<p>In these days the town is recovering at last from the
undeserved neglect into which it fell after the illness and death
of George III. and from later disasters and indifferences; and,
what with improved railway travelling, and the added interest it
obtains from being selected as the site of a new great national
harbour where more than ever the ships of the Navy will come and
go, has a great future before it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">THE ISLE OF
PORTLAND</p>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the generality of untravelled
folk, Portland is nothing but a quarry and a prison.&nbsp; It is
both and more.&nbsp; It is, for one additional thing, a fortress,
in these times grown to a considerable strength, and, for
another, is a singular outlying corner of England tethered to the
mainland only by that seemingly precarious stretch of pebbles,
the Chesil Beach.&nbsp; As Weymouth is peculiarly the scene of
<i>The Trumpet Major</i>, so Portland, the &ldquo;Isle of
Slingers,&rdquo; as Mr. Hardy calls it, is especially, though not
with absolute exclusiveness, the district of <i>The Well
Beloved</i>.</p>
<p>There is a choice of ways to Portland.&nbsp; You may go by the
high road&mdash;and a very steep up and down road it is,
too&mdash;past Wyke, or may proceed by the crumbling clifflets
past Sandsfoot Castle, one of those blockhouse coastward
fortresses stretching from Deal and Sandown Castles, in Kent,
along the whole of the south coast, to this point, whose building
we owe to the panic that possessed the nation in the time of
Henry VIII.: one of those periodic fears of a French invasion
that from time to time have troubled the powers that be.&nbsp;
Two of the long series were placed in this neighbourhood; <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>the
so-styled &ldquo;Portland Castle&rdquo; at the base of the Isle
of Portland itself, and this craggy ruin of Sandsfoot, roofless
and rough and more cliff-like than the cliffs themselves, at the
mainland extremity of this sheltered inlet, wherein, in days of
yore, an enemy might conceivably have effected a lodgment.&nbsp;
For the defence of this fort, when new-builded in the Eighth
Harry&rsquo;s time, there were to be provided &ldquo;the nombre
of xv hable footmen, well furneyshed for the warres, as
appertayneth,&rdquo; together with some &ldquo;harchers&rdquo;
duly furnished, or &ldquo;harmed&rdquo; as the summons might have
put it, with their &ldquo;bows and harrowes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas!
poor overworked letter H!</p>

<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>It is
here, in the story of <i>The Well Beloved</i>, that Jocelyn
Pierston, the weirdly constituted hero of that fantastic romance,
elects to bid farewell to Avice Caro, and past it Anne Garland
went on her way to Portland Bill, &ldquo;along the coast road to
Portland.&rdquo;&nbsp; When she had reached the waters of the
Fleet, crossed now by a bridge, she had to ferry over, and from
thence to walk that causeway road whose mile-and-three-quarters
of flatness, bounded sideways by the expressionless blue of the
summer sky and the equally vacant vastnesses of the yellow
pebbles of the Chesil Beach, seems to foot-passengers an image of
eternity.&nbsp; It is but a flat road, less than two miles long,
but the Isle ahead seems to keep as far off as ever, and the way
is so bald of incident that a sea-poppy growing amid the pebbles
is a change for the eye, a piece of driftwood a landmark, and a
chance boat or capstan a monument.</p>
<p>But even the Chesil Beach has an end, and at last one reaches
Portland and Fortune&rsquo;s Well, referred to in that story of
the Portlanders as &ldquo;the Street of Wells.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
well&mdash;a wishing well of the good, or the bad, old sort,
where you wished for your heart&rsquo;s desire, and perhaps
obtained the boon in the course of a lifetime&mdash;by striving
and labouring for it&mdash;is behind that substantial inn, the
Portland Arms, and it is a cynical commentary upon this and all
such legends of fa&euml;ry that, while the Portlanders in
general, and the people of Fortune&rsquo;s Well in particular,
can one and all direct you to the inn, if so be you are bat-like
enough not to perceive it for yourself, very few of them know
anything at all of the magic spring, of where it is, or that the
<a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>place
took its name from the existence of such a thing.</p>
<p>One circumstance, above all other curious and interesting
circumstances of this so-called &ldquo;Isle&rdquo; of Portland,
is calculated to impress the stranger with astonishment.&nbsp;
Its giant forts; its great convict establishment, &ldquo;the
retreat, at their country&rsquo;s expense, of geniuses from a
distance,&rdquo; the odd nexus of almost interminable pebble
beach that tethers it to the mainland and makes the name of
&ldquo;Isle&rdquo; a misnomer, are all fitting things for
amazement; but no one previously uninformed on the point is at
all likely to have any conception of its numerous villages and
hamlets and the large populations inhabiting this grim,
forbidding, &ldquo;solid and single block of limestone four miles
long.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eleven thousand souls live and move and have
their being on what the uninstructed, gazing across the Roads
from Weymouth, might be excused for thinking a penitential rock,
reserved for forts and garrison artillery, and for convicts and
those whose business it is to keep them in order.&nbsp; The
number of small villages or hamlets is itself in the nature of a
surprise.&nbsp; Entering upon this happily styled
&ldquo;Gibraltar of Wessex,&rdquo; there is in the foreground, by
the railway-station, Chesilton; succeeded by Fortune&rsquo;s
Well, Castleton to the left, Portland to the right, and, away
ahead up to the summit of a stupendous climb on to the great
elevated, treeless and parched stony plateau of the Isle,
Reforne.&nbsp; Beyond the prison and the prison quarries, come
Easton, Wakeham, Weston, and Southwell; all stony and
hard-featured and like nothing else but each other.&nbsp; To-day
an exploration of the Isle is easy, for a railway runs <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>from
Weymouth along the beach to Chesilton, and another, skirting the
cliffs, takes you out almost to the famous Bill itself; but
otherwise, all the circumstances of the place still fully show
how the Portlanders came to be that oddly different race from the
mainlanders they are shown to be in the pages of <i>The Well
Beloved</i>, and in the writings of innumerable authors.</p>
<p>Portland was to the ancients the Isle of Vindilis, the
&ldquo;Vindelia&rdquo; of Richard of Cirencester; and Roman roads
are surviving on it to this day, notwithstanding the blasting and
quarrying activities of this vast bed of building-stone, whence
much of the material for Sir Christopher Wren&rsquo;s City of
London churches came, and despite the business of fortification
that has abolished many merely antiquarian interests.&nbsp; You,
indeed, cannot get away from stone, here on Portland; physically,
in historic allusions, and in matters of present-day
business.&nbsp; The story of the Isle begins with it, with those
ancient inhabitants, the <i>Baleares</i>, slingers of stones, who
made excellent defence of their unfertile home with the
inexhaustible natural ammunition; and quarrying is now, after the
passing of many centuries, its one industry.&nbsp; It is to be
supposed, without any extravagance of assumption, that the
Portlanders of to-day are the descendants of those ancient
Baleares, and, certainly until quite recent times, they
maintained the aloofness and marked individuality to be expected
from such an ancestry.&nbsp; To them the mainlanders were
foreigners, or, as themselves would say,
&ldquo;kimberlins&rdquo;; a flighty, mercurial and none too
scrupulous people, calling themselves Englishmen, who lived on
the adjacent island of Great Britain and <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>were only
to be dealt with cautiously, and then solely on matters of
business connected with the selling of stone, or maybe of fish,
caught in Deadman&rsquo;s Bay.&nbsp; For the true Portlanders,
like their home, are grey and unsmiling, and reflect their
surroundings, even as do those inhabitants of more sheltered and
fertile places; and still, although things be in these later days
of railway communication and a kind of quick-change and
&ldquo;general-post&rdquo; all over the country somewhat altered,
a stranger, who by force of circumstances&mdash;pleasure is out
of the question&mdash;comes to live here, will find himself as
uncongenial as oil is to water.</p>
<p>The outlook of the old Portlanders upon strangers was
justified to them, in a way, when the great prison was built and
the gangs of convicts began to be a feature of the Isle.&nbsp;
<i>They</i>, who thus by force of circumstances over which they
had no control, took up a hard-working and frugal existence upon
the Isle, were specimens of the &ldquo;kimberlins&rdquo;; and the
prejudices, if not quite the ignorance, of the islanders saw in
them representative specimens of all
&ldquo;Outlanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you come toilsomely uphill from Fortune&rsquo;s Well, out
upon the stony plateau that is Portland, you presently become
conscious of the contiguity of that great convict establishment,
in the appearance of notice-boards, warning all and sundry of the
penalties awaiting those who aid prisoners to escape.&nbsp; Such
an offence, you learn, &ldquo;shall be treated as a felony, not
subject to any bail or mainprize&rdquo; (whatever that may
be).&nbsp; But any &ldquo;free person&rdquo; finding money,
letters, or clothing, or anything that may be supposed to have
been left to facilitate <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>the escape of prisoners shall be
rewarded, unless such person shall be proved to have entered into
collusion, etc., etc., and so forth.</p>
<p>What, however, one especially desires to call attention to is
the delicious expression, &ldquo;free person.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Obviously, to the official minds ruling Portland &ldquo;free
persons&rdquo; owe their freedom, not to any virtues they
possess, but to their luck in not being found out.&nbsp; One,
being a &ldquo;free person,&rdquo; has, therefore, after reading
this notice, an uneasy suspicion that freedom is, in the eye of
those authorities, a wholly undeserved accident, and that if
every one&mdash;saving, of course, officials&mdash;had their
deserts, they would be cutting and hauling stone out yonder, with
the gangs in those yellow jackets and knickerbockers plentifully
decorated with a pleasing design in broad arrows.</p>
<p>Being merely a &ldquo;free person,&rdquo; without prejudice in
one&rsquo;s favour in the eyes of the armed warders who abound
here, it behoves one to walk circumspectly on Portland.</p>
<p>A great deal might be said of the Convict Prison and its
quarries.&nbsp; It is another &ldquo;sermon in stones,&rdquo;
quite as effective as the sermons preached by those other stones
referred to in the lines</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . books in the running brooks,<br />
Sermons in stones, and good in everything,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the text, I take it, is the amended and horribly
sophisticated one: &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal&mdash;or, if you
must, do it outside the cognisance of the criminal
laws!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this only in passing.&nbsp; Literary landmarks have
fortunately, no points of contact with burglars, <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>fraudulent
trustees, and swindling promoters of companies.&nbsp; We will
make for Pennsylvania Castle, very slightly disguised in <i>The
Well Beloved</i> as &ldquo;Sylvania Castle,&rdquo; the residence
of Jocelyn Pierston in that story.&nbsp; Coming to it, past the
cottage of Avice, down that street innocent of vegetation, the
thickets of trees surrounding the Castle (which is not a castle,
but only a castellated mansion built in 1800 by Wyatt, in true
Wyattesque fashion, for the then Governor of the Isle) are seen,
closing in the view.&nbsp; A tree is something more than a tree
on stony, wind-swept Portland.&nbsp; Any tree here is a landmark,
and a grove of trees a feature; and thus, in the thickets and
cliffside undergrowths of &ldquo;Sylvania Castle,&rdquo; that
justify the name and <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>give the lie to any who may in more
than general terms declare Portland to be treeless, the boskage
is therefore more than usually gracious.</p>

<img alt=

"Bow and Arrow Castle"
 src="images/p229.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Many incidents in the elfish career of Pierston are made to
happen here.&nbsp; The first Avice was courted by him in the
churchyard down below, where a landslip has swept away the little
church that gave to Church Hope Cove its name, and Avice the
third eloped with another&mdash;that Another who with that
capital A lurks between the pages of every novel, and behind the
scenes in most plays&mdash;down the steep lane that runs beneath
the archways of &ldquo;Rufus&rsquo;,&rdquo; or Bow and Arrow,
Castle on to the rocks beside the raging sea.</p>
<p>By lengthy cliff-top ways we leave this spot and make for
Portland Bill, whence Anne Garland tearfully watched the topsails
and then the topgallants, and at last the admiral&rsquo;s flag of
the <i>Victory</i> drop down towards, and into, the watery
distance.&nbsp; Offshore is the Shambles lightship that gave a
refuge to the fleeing Avice and Leverre.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;wild, herbless, weatherworn promontory,&rdquo;
called Portland Bill, with its two lighthouses looking down upon
shoals and rapid currents of extraordinary danger to mariners,
obtains its name from the beak-like end of the Isle which
&ldquo;stretches out like the head of a bird into the English
Channel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other, and more fanciful and wonder-loving
accounts would have us believe that it derives from this being
the site of propitiatory Baal fires in far-off pagan times; and,
if we like to carry on the fancy, we may draw comparisons between
the fires of the shivering superstitious terrors of those old
heathens, and the beneficent warning gleams maintained here <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>in modern
times by the Trinity House, for the benefit of &ldquo;they that
go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completing the circuit of Portland, the return to
Fortune&rsquo;s Well and Chesilton is made chiefly along high
ground disclosing a comprehensive and beautiful view of the whole
westward sweep of the Dorset coast, where the many miles of the
Chesil Beach at last lose themselves in hazy distance, and the
heights of Stonebarrow and Golden Cap, between Bridport and Lyme
Regis, pierce the skies.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WEYMOUTH TO
BRIDPORT AND BEAMINSTER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> leave Weymouth by this route is
to obtain some initial impressions of a very striking character:
impressions, not slight or fleeting, of hilliness and of
Weymouth&rsquo;s modern growth.&nbsp; A specious and illusory
flat quayside stretch of road, by the well-known swan-haunted
Backwater, ends all too soon, and the road goes at a grievous
inclination up through what was once the village, now the suburb,
and a very packed and populous suburb, too, of East
Chickerell.&nbsp; To this succeeds the Chickerell of the West;
and so, in and out and round about, and up and down&mdash;but
chiefly up&mdash;at last to Portisham, the first place of any
Hardyean interest.</p>
<p>Portisham, under the bold hills that rise to the commanding
height of Blackdown&mdash;locally &ldquo;Black&rsquo;on,&rdquo;
just as the name of the village is shortened to
&ldquo;Po&rsquo;sham&rdquo;&mdash;rising eight hundred and
seventeen feet above the sea, is notable to us both from fiction
and in facts.&nbsp; It appears in <i>The Trumpet Major</i> as the
village to which Bob Loveday comes to seek service under Admiral
Hardy, and although the brave but sentimentally flighty Bob be a
character of fiction, the admiral is that very real historical <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>personage,
Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy, Nelson&rsquo;s friend and
comrade-in-arms, who was born here, in the house still pointed
out, in 1769, and to whose memory the conspicuous monument on
Blackdown is erected.&nbsp; The house is the first on the left,
at the cross-roads as you make for <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>the village.&nbsp; In the garden
belonging to it, on the opposite side of the road may still be
seen a sundial, bearing the inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Joseph Hardy</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq</span>.,<br />
Kingston Russell.&nbsp; Lat. 50&deg; 45&prime;<br />

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>It is a lovely perspective along the road approaching
Portisham, disclosing a long avenue of poplars and ashes, with
the village church and some scattered farmsteads in the vale, and
the tremendous sides of the rolling down, covered in patches with
furze, filling in the background.&nbsp; The beautiful old church
has, happily, been left very much to itself, with the
lichen-stains of age and other marks of time not yet scraped
off.&nbsp; A strange epitaph in the churchyard provokes
curiosity:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;William Weare lies here in dust,<br />
As thou and I and all men must.<br />
Once plundered by Sabean force,<br />
Some cald it war but others worse.<br />
With confidence he pleads his cavse,<br />
And Kings to be above those laws.<br />
September&rsquo;s eygth day died hee<br />
When neare the date of 63<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anno domini 1670.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those Sabines appear from the internal evidence of the epitaph
to have been the Roundhead party, and &ldquo;rebellion,&rdquo; or
perhaps &ldquo;robbery,&rdquo; to have been the worse thing than
war some called it.&nbsp; The allusion is probably to some raid
in which cows and sheep were carried off by the Puritans and were
grudged them by the loyal Weare, who seems, <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>in the
passage where he claims &ldquo;Kings to be above those
laws,&rdquo; to have cheerfully borne some other foray on the
Royalists&rsquo; behalf.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Two miles from Portisham is the large village of Abbotsbury,
not itself the scene of any of the Wessex romances, but
intrinsically a very interesting place, remarkable for a hilltop
chapel of St. Catherine anciently serving as a seamark, and for
the remains of the Abbey; few, and chiefly worked into farmsteads
and cottages, but including a great stone barn of the fifteenth
century, as long as a cathedral, and very cathedral-like in its
plan.</p>
<p>The great barn of <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>, scene of
the sheep-shearing, is really a description of the monastic barn
of Abbotsbury, which, as in the story, resembles a church with
transepts.&nbsp; &ldquo;It not only emulated the form of the
neighbouring church of the parish, but vied with it in antiquity.
. . .&nbsp; The vast porches at the sides, lofty enough to admit
a waggon laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf, were
spanned by heavy pointed arches of stone, broadly and boldly cut,
whose very simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not apparent
in erections where more ornament has been attempted.&nbsp; The
dusky, filmed chestnut roof, braced and tied in by huge collars,
curves, and diagonals was far nobler in design, because more
wealthy in material, than nine-tenths of those in our modern
churches.&nbsp; Along each side wall was a range of striding
buttresses, throwing deep shadows on the spaces between them,
which were perforated by lancet openings, combining in their
proportions the precise requirements, both of beauty and
ventilation.&nbsp; One could say about this barn, what <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>could
hardly be said of either the church or the castle akin to it in
age and style, that the purpose which had dictated its original
erection was the same with that to which it was still
applied.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Out of Abbotsbury, and down amid the waters of the West Fleet,
is the famous Swannery, where, amid reedy lakes and marshes, some
thousands of swans have from ancient times had a home.&nbsp; Once
belonging to the Church, in the persons of the old abbots of the
Benedictine abbey of Abbotsbury, the swans are now the property
of the Earl of Ilchester, descendant of the &ldquo;First Countess
of Wessex,&rdquo; Betty Dornell, whose romance is set forth in
<i>A Group of Noble Dames</i>.&nbsp; Though long passed from the
hands of any religious establishment, the ownership of the swans
still points with the trifling alteration in the position of an
apostrophe, to the fact that &ldquo;the earth is the Lords&rsquo;
and the fulness thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight miles of cliff-top roads, with magnificent views to the
left over sea and coast, and other views equally magnificent
inland, to the right, lead in staggering drops and rises past
Swyre and Puncknowle down to Burton Bradstock, and thence to the
&ldquo;unheard-of harbour&rdquo; of West Bay.</p>
<p>West Bay, and Bridport town itself, are scenes in <i>Fellow
Townsmen</i>, where they are called &ldquo;Port Bredy,&rdquo;
from the little river, the Brit or Bredy, which here flows into
the sea.&nbsp; West Bay is one of the oddest places on an odd and
original coast.&nbsp; A mile and a half away from Bridport town,
which is content to hide, sheltering away from the sea-breezes,
it has always been about to become great, either as a commercial
harbour or a seaside resort, <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>or both, but has ended in not
achieving greatness of any kind.&nbsp; No one who enjoys the
sight of a quiet and picturesque place will sorrow at that.</p>
<p>Picturesque it is in a wholly accidental and unstudied
way.&nbsp; It owns a little harbour, with quays and an inn or
two, and shipping that, daring greatly, has to be warped in
between the narrow timbered pier-heads, where a furious sea is
for ever banging in from the unsheltered bay; and away at one
side it is shut in from the outside coast by some saucy-looking
cliffs of golden yellow sandstone, whose odd effect is due to
their being the remaining part of a symmetrically rounded
down.&nbsp; The seaward part has been shorn off, with the odd
result that the rest looks like the quarter of some gigantic
Dutch cheese of pantomime.&nbsp; It is an eloquent, stimulating,
not unpleasing loneliness that characterises the shore of West
Bay.&nbsp; A few old thatched houses, halting midway between an
inland and a coastwise picturesqueness, and so only succeeding in
being broken-heartedly nondescript, start out of wastes of tiny
shingle, and are backed at a discreet distance by a long row of
modern houses, whose architect is so often on their account
professionally spoken of as a genius, that it becomes a duty to
state, however convenient to the residents in them their plan may
be, that their appearance in the view is the one pictorial
drawback to West Bay.</p>
<p>The microscopic shingle&mdash;for shingle it is&mdash;of West
Bay has for centuries been the enemy of the place and has
practically strangled it.&nbsp; There are heaped up wastes of it
everywhere, and every visitor involuntarily carries some of it
away, as a sample, <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>about his person, in his shoes or his hair, or in his
pockets.&nbsp; The more of it removed in this, or indeed in any
other manner, the better pleased will West Bay be, for it comes,
unasked, into the houses; you have it for breakfast, lunch, tea,
and supper, as an unsolicited garnish to the viands, and when at
last you seek repose between the sheets, there it is again.&nbsp;
These wastes are part of that natural phenomenon of the Dorset
coast, the Chesil Beach, which runs eighteen miles from this
point along the perfectly unbroken shores of the Bay to Chesilton
and Portland.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Chesil&rdquo; is just the
&ldquo;Pebble&rdquo; beach: that old word for pebbles being found
elsewhere in Dorsetshire, and at Chislehurst, among other
places.&nbsp; A pecularity of it is that by insensible degrees it
grows coarser as it proceeds in a south-easterly direction,
ending as very large pebbles at Portland.&nbsp; The fishermen of
this lonely coast, landing on dark nights, with nothing else to
guide them as to their whereabouts, can always readily settle the
point by handling this shingle, and by use can tell within a mile
of the particular spot.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The story of West Bay&rsquo;s struggle against this insidious
enemy is an old one.&nbsp; In 1722 the Bridport authorities
procured an Act of Parliament empowering them to restore and
rebuild the haven and port, the piers and landing-places, in
order to bring the town to that ancient and flourishing state
whence it had declined.&nbsp; The preamble stated that by reason
of a great sickness and other accidents, the wealthy inhabitants
had been swept away and the haven choked.&nbsp; But although the
Legislature had given authority for the work to be done, it did
not indicate <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>whence the funds were to be obtained, and so it was not
until 1742 that the pier, authorised twenty years before, was
built, nor was it until another fourteen years had waned that the
pier and harbour were enlarged.&nbsp; Mr. Hardy in <i>Fellow
Townsmen</i> thus describes West Bay: &ldquo;A gap appeared in
the rampart of hills which shut out the sea, and on the left of
the opening rose a vertical cliff, coloured a burning orange by
the sunlight, the companion cliff on the right side being livid
in shade.&nbsp; Between these cliffs, like the Libyan Bay which
sheltered the shipwrecked Trojans, was a little haven, seemingly
a beginning made by Nature herself of a perfect harbour, which
appealed to the passer-by as only requiring a little human
industry to finish it and make it famous, the ground on each
side, as far back as the daisied slopes that bounded the interior
valley, being a mere layer of blown sand.&nbsp; But the
Port-Bredy burgesses a mile inland had, in the course of ten
centuries, responded many times to that mute appeal, with the
result that the tides had invariably choked up their works with
sand and shingle as soon as completed.&nbsp; There were but few
houses here: a rough pier, a few boats, some stores, an inn, a
residence or two, a ketch unloading in the harbour, were the
chief features of the settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The harbour road, along whose mile and a half, the
domestically unhappy Barnet went to see his Lucy at various
intervals of time, leads into the corporate town of Bridport,
which, after long remaining, as far as the casual eye of the
stranger may perceive, little affected by the circumstance of
being on a railway, is now developing a something in the nature
of a suburb, greatly to the dismay of <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>neighbouring residents who, residing
here because of its isolation on a branch railway that brings few
passengers, and to landward of a harbour that has no commerce,
now can glimpse at the end of a vista of years some prospect of
the ancient peace of Bridport being genteelly disturbed.</p>
<p>Bridport was, in those days when it remained a busy place, a
town keenly interested in the flax, hemp, twine, and rope
industries; and rope and twine walks, where the old methods are
even yet in use, are still features of its less prominent lanes
and alleys, but the unobservant and the incurious, who to be sure
form the majority of travellers, might pass, and do pass, through
Bridport, without thinking it any other than a quiet market town,
dependent solely upon surrounding agricultural needs and weekly
village shopping.</p>
<p>When hemp was grown in the neighbourhood of Bridport, in those
bustling days when the manufacturers of the town supplied the
King&rsquo;s Navy with ropes, and criminals were suspended by
this staple article of the town, the expression &ldquo;stabbed
with a Bridport dagger,&rdquo; was a pretty, or at least a
symbolical, way of saying that a man had been hanged.&nbsp; It
was a figure of speech that quite escaped that matter-of-fact
antiquary, Leland, when in the time of Henry VIII. he came to
Bridport and stolidly noted down: &ldquo;At Bridport be made good
daggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One is disposed to sympathise with Leland in that egregious
error of his, for which he and his memory have been laughed at
for more than three hundred and fifty years.&nbsp; How his shade
must writhe at the shame of it!&nbsp; He was, doubtless, tired <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>and bored,
for some reason or another, when he reached Bridport, and to his
undoing, took things on trust.&nbsp; And nowadays, every one who
writes the very leastest scrap on Bridport has his fling at the
poor old fellow; and I&mdash;conscience tells
me&mdash;insincerely do the same, under a miserably inadequate

<p>Barnet, whose baulked love is the theme of <i>Fellow
Townsmen</i>, was descended from the hemp and rope-merchants of
Bridport, as the story, in several allusions, tells us.</p>
<p>South Street, leading from the Harbour Road into the right and
left course of the main street, contains most of the very few
buildings of any great age.&nbsp; Among them is the little
Gothic, gabled building now a workmen&rsquo;s club, but once the
&ldquo;Castle&rdquo; inn.&nbsp; Here, too, is the church, ancient
enough, but restored <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>in 1860, when the two bays were
added to the nave; probably the incident referred to by Mr.
Hardy: &ldquo;The church had had such a tremendous practical joke
played upon it by some facetious restorer or other as to be
scarce recognisable by its dearest old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is, in this otherwise rather bald interior of Bridport
church, a curious mural tablet to the &ldquo;Memory of Edward
Coker, Gent.&nbsp; Second son of Capt. Robert Coker of Mapowder,
Slayne at the Bull Inn, in Bridpur<sup>t</sup>.&nbsp; June the
14<sup>th</sup> A&ntilde;. D&otilde;. 1685, by one Venner, who
was a Officer unde<sup>r</sup> the late Dvke of
Mvnmovt<sup>h</sup> in that Rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bull inn stands yet in the main street, but
modernised.&nbsp; It is the original of the &ldquo;Black
Bull&rdquo; in <i>Fellow Townsmen</i>.</p>
<p>Six miles due north of Bridport lies the little town of
Beaminster, the &ldquo;hill-surrounded little town&rdquo; of
which Angel Clare&rsquo;s father was vicar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sweet
Be&rsquo;mi&rsquo;ster&rdquo; says Barnes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sweet Be&rsquo;mi&rsquo;ster, that bist
abound<br />
By green and woody hills all round,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and in truth those hills that surround it are set about this
quiet agricultural town in a manner that fairly astounds the
traveller.&nbsp; No railway reaches &ldquo;Emminster,&rdquo; as
it is named in <i>Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>, and,
looking upon those mighty natural turrets and domes that beset
it, the traveller is of opinion that no railway ever will.&nbsp;
Nearing Beaminster at cockshut time, when the birds have all gone
to bed, when the sky is hot in the west with the burnished copper
of the after-glow, and a <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>cold blue and green, with pale stars
appearing, fills the eastern firmament, the scenery is something
awesome and approaching an Alpine sublimity.&nbsp; Then the
twilight streets of this quiet place in the basin-like hollow
begin to take an hospitable look, and the tall red stone tower of
the church, that looks so nobly aloof in day, assumes a welcoming
paternal benignancy.&nbsp; It is a toilsome winning to
Beaminster, but, when won, worth the trouble of it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WEYMOUTH TO
LULWORTH COVE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> cannot go far from Weymouth
without a good deal of hill-climbing, but the longest stretch of
level in this district, where levels are the exception and hills
the rule, is by this route.&nbsp; It is not so very long, even
then, for when you have passed the curving Esplanade and Lodmoor
Marsh, and come to the foot of Jordan Hill, thought to have been
the site of the Roman &ldquo;Clavinium,&rdquo; it is only two and
a half miles.&nbsp; Preston stands on the top of a further hill,
and is a place of great resort for brake-parties not greatly
interested in literature.&nbsp; Turning to the left out of its
street, opposite the Ship inn, we come to the pretty
village&mdash;or hamlet, for no church is visible&mdash;of Sutton
Poyntz, the &ldquo;Overcombe&rdquo; of <i>The Trumpet
Major</i>.&nbsp; Its thatched stone cottages, charming
tree-shaded stream and mill-pond, and old barns, all under the
looming shadow of the downs, vividly recall the old-fashioned
ways and talk, and the pleasant romance of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s only
semi-historical novel; and you need not see, if you do not wish,
the flagrant Vandalism of the Weymouth waterworks, hard by, and
can if you will, turn your back upon the inn that will be
interesting and <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>picturesque some day, but now, rawly new, is an outrage
upon, and a thing altogether out of key with, these old rustic
surroundings.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Squawking ducks, hurrying across the dusty road and flouncing
noisily into the clearly running stream, rooks cawing contentedly
from their windy see-saw in the topmost branches of tall trees;
and tired horses coming stolidly home from plough are the chief
features of this &ldquo;Overcombe,&rdquo; where John Loveday had
his mill, and his sons John and Bob, and Anne Garland and
Matilda, and all the lovable, the hateful, or the merely
contemptible characters in that sympathetic tale came and
went.&nbsp; The mill&mdash;I am afraid it is not <i>the</i> mill,
but one of somewhat later date&mdash;still grinds corn, and you
can see it, bulking <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>very largely between the trees,
&ldquo;the smooth millpond, over-full, and intruding into the
hedge and into the road,&rdquo; as mill-ponds will do, even in
these later days of strict local government.&nbsp; But the days
of European wars are gone.&nbsp; It is a hundred years since the
last call of brave, tender, loyal John Loveday, the Trumpet
Major, was silenced on a bloody battlefield in Spain, and well on
toward the same tale of years since the press gangs, fellows to
that which searched Overcombe Mill for Bob Loveday, impressed
likely fellows for service on His Majesty&rsquo;s
ships:&mdash;the characters of <i>The Trumpet Major</i> belong
wholly to a bygone age.</p>
<p>To the same age belonged the characters in <i>The Melancholy
Hussar of the German Legion</i>, a short story associated with
Bincombe, a tiny village it requires no little exertion to reach;
but you may win this way to it as easily&mdash;or at any rate,
not more laboriously&mdash;than by any other route.&nbsp; It
stands up among the downs, and in what Dorset folk would call an
&ldquo;outspan&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say a remote hollow,
recess or shelf amid them, where their sides are so steep that
they give the appearance of some theatrical
&ldquo;back-cloth&rdquo; to a romantic scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here stretch the downs, high and breezy and green,
absolutely unchanged since those eventful days.&nbsp; A plough
has never disturbed the turf, and the sod that was uppermost then
is uppermost now.&nbsp; Here stood the camp; here are distinct
traces of the banks thrown up for the horses of the cavalry, and
spots where the midden heaps lay are still to be observed.&nbsp;
At night, when I walk across the lonely place, it is impossible
to avoid <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>hearing, amid the scourings of the wind over the
grass-bents and thistles, the old trumpet and bugle-calls, the
rattle of the halters; to help seeing rows of spectral tents and
the <i>impedimenta</i> of the soldiery.&nbsp; From within the
canvases come guttural syllables of foreign tongues, and broken
songs of the fatherland; for they were mainly regiments of the
King&rsquo;s German Legion that slept round the tent-poles
hereabout at that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story associated with this out-of-the-way place <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>is one in
its chief lines true to facts, for in an unmarked grave within
the little churchyard, lie two young German soldiers, shot for
desertion from the York Hussars, as quoted at the end of the
story from the register:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matth: Tina (Corpl.) in His Majesty&rsquo;s Regiment of
York Hussars, and shot for Desertion, was Buried June 30th, 1801,
aged 22 years.&nbsp; Born in the town of Sarrbruk,
Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christop Bless, belonging to His Majesty&rsquo;s
Regiment of York Hussars, who was shot for Desertion, was Buried
June 30th, 1801, aged 22 years.&nbsp; Born at Lothaargen,
Alsatia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning from Bincombe and down again through Sutton Poyntz
to Preston, we come to Osmington, with views down along on the
right to Ringstead Bay; but, avoiding for the present the coast,
strike inland, to Poxwell, the &ldquo;Oxwell Hall&rdquo; of
<i>The Trumpet Major</i>.&nbsp; It is really three miles from
&ldquo;Overcombe,&rdquo; and therefore not the close neighbour to
the Lovedays it is made to be, for the purposes of the
novel.&nbsp; The church stands beside of the road, the old
manor-house, now a farmstead, the home of &ldquo;Uncle
Benjy,&rdquo; miserly Squire Derriman, close by.&nbsp; In old
days, back in 1634, when it was built, this curiously walled-in
residence with its outer porter&rsquo;s lodge, the physical and
visible sign of an ever-present distrust of strangers, was a seat
of the Henning family.&nbsp; That lodge still stands, obsolete as
an <i>avant-garde</i> and gazebo for the timely spying out of
unwelcome visitors, but very admirable for a summer-house, if the
farmer had leisure for such things.&nbsp; But as he has not, but
must continually &ldquo;plough and sow, and reap and <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>mow,&rdquo;
or see that others do so, the lodge is in every way a
derelict.&nbsp; The farmer could perhaps add some testimony of
his own respecting all those &ldquo;romantic excellencies and
practical drawbacks,&rdquo; mentioned in the story, and existing
in fact; but, farmers having a bent towards practicality,
although they discuss, rather than practise it, it is to be
supposed that he would place a stress upon the drawbacks, to the
neglect of the romance.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Pursuing the road onwards from Poxwell, we come, in a mile and
a half, to the cross-roads at &ldquo;Warm&rsquo;ell Cross,&rdquo;
<a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>leading
on the left to Dorchester, on the right to Wareham, and straight
ahead across the remotenesses of &ldquo;Egdon Heath,&rdquo; to
Moreton station.&nbsp; Here we turn to the right, and so miss the
village of Warmwell, whence the cross roads take their
name.&nbsp; It is not by any means, to the ordinary traveller, a
remarkable crossing of the roads, but it has associations for the
pilgrim stored with the literary lore of the Hardy Country, for
it was here, in the story of <i>The Distracted Preacher</i>, that
Mr. Stockdale, the Wesleyan minister of Nether Mynton, by the aid
of their voices, crying &ldquo;Hoi&mdash;hoi&mdash;hoi!&nbsp;
Help, help!&rdquo; discovered Will Latimer and the exciseman tied
to the trees by the smuggler friends of his Lizzie.&nbsp; Turning
here to the right, Owermoigne itself&mdash;the &ldquo;Nether
Mynton&rdquo; of that tale of smuggled spirits and religious
scruples&mdash;is reached in another mile; the church and its
tiny village of thatched rusticity standing shyly, as such a
smuggler&rsquo;s haunt should do, off the broad high road and
down a little stumbly and rutty lane.&nbsp; The body of the
church has been rebuilt since Lizzie Newberry and her friends
stored &ldquo;the stuff&rdquo; in the tower and the churchyard,
but that churchyard remains the same, as also does the tower from
whose battlements the &ldquo;free traders&rdquo; spied upon the
excisemen, searching for those hidden tubs.</p>
<p>From this road there is a better distant view of the great
equestrian effigy of George III., cut in the chalky southern
slopes of the downs, than from any other point.&nbsp; He looks
impressive, in the ghostly sort, seen across the bare slopes,
where perhaps an occasional farmstead or barton, or a row of
wheat-ricks, accentuates the solitude and at <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>the same
time gives scale to the chalky effigies of His Majesty and that
very elegant horse of his, showing how very large this horse and
rider really are.&nbsp; The gallant Trumpet Major told about the
making of this memorial, as he and Anne Garland walked among the
flowering peas, and described what this &ldquo;huge picture of
the king on horseback in the earth of the hill&rdquo; was to be
like: &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s head is to be as big as our
mill-pond, and his body as big as this garden; he and the horse
will cover more than an acre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here he is to this day, very spirited and martial, with
his cocked hat and marshal&rsquo;s baton.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is, however, a weariful business to arrive in the
neighbourhood of him, for those chalk downs are just as
inhospitable in the sun as they are in the storms of winter, the
only difference lying between being fried on their shelterless
sides when the thermometer registers ninety degrees, or frozen
when the mercury sinks towards zero.</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>Some
two miles of highway along the verge of Egdon Heath bring us to a
right-hand turning, leading past Winfrith Newburgh by a somewhat
more shaded route up over the crest of these chalky ranges, and
then with several turnings, steeply down, and at length,
&ldquo;by and large&rdquo;&mdash;as sailors say&mdash;to the
village of West Lulworth, which lies at the inland end of a
coombe, the better part of a mile from Lulworth Cove.</p>

</a></p>
<p>To Lulworth&mdash;or as he terms it, Lullstead&mdash;Cove, Mr.
Hardy returns again and again.&nbsp; It is the &ldquo;small basin
of sea enclosed by the cliffs&rdquo; where Troy bathed and was
supposed to have been drowned; it is one of the spots where
<i>The Distracted Preacher&rsquo;s</i> parishioners landed their
smuggled spirit-tubs, and <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>upon its milk-white shores of
limestone pebbles the lifeless bodies of Stephen Hardcombe and
his companion were found.&nbsp; It was the first meeting-place of
Cytherea Graye and Edward Springrove; and was, again, that
&ldquo;three-quarter round Cove&rdquo; where, &ldquo;screened
from every mortal eye,&rdquo; save his own, Solomon Selby
observed Bonaparte questing along the darkling shore for a
suitable place where his flotilla might land in his projected
invasion of England.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=
"Lulworth Cove.  The coastgard station"
title=
"Lulworth Cove.  The coastgard station"
 src="images/p255.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Lulworth Cove is an almost perfect circle, eaten out of the
limestone in the long ago by the sea, in an unusually geometrical
manner.&nbsp; Bindon Hill frowns down upon it, and in summer the
circle of light-blue water laughs saucily back, in little
sparkling ripples, just as though there were no storms in nature
and no cruel rock-bound coast <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>outside.&nbsp; The Cove is, if you
be classically minded, a Bath of the Naiads; and, if less
imaginative, is at any rate a delightful spot that even in these
tidied-up and ordered days, when every little seaside cove has
its hair brushed and face scrubbed, and is made always to look
its Sunday best, persists in being littered with a longshore
fishing and boating medley of anchors and lobster-pots, ropes,
chains and windlasses, infinitely more pleasing to right-thinking
persons&mdash;by whom I indicate those who think with
myself&mdash;than the neatest of promenades and seats.&nbsp;
True, they have rebuilt or enlarged the Cove Hotel and red-brick
manifestations of a growing favour with visitors are springing up
beside the old thatched cottages; but Lulworth&mdash;Cove or
village&mdash;is not spoiled yet.&nbsp; The Coastguard Station,
perched on what looks like a hazardous pinnacle of cliff, with
the wild chasm of Stair Hole to one side of it and the sheer drop
into the Cove on the other, is the most striking feature, looking
down from landward, of this curious place, which has not its
fellow anywhere else, and is the sunniest, the ruggedest, and
certainly the most treeless place along the Dorset coast.</p>
<p>To those who have persevered along the roads into Lulworth,
the prospect of again climbing those hills is perhaps a little
grim, and they should so contrive to time their arrival and
departure that they comfortably fit in with the return to
Weymouth of the excursion steamer plying in the tourist season
between the two places.</p>

POOLE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bournemouth</span>, the
&ldquo;Sandbourne&rdquo; of <i>Tess of the
D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i> and of minor incidents and passing
allusions in others of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s novels, is one of the
principal gates of entrance to his Wessex.&nbsp; Just within the
western borders of Hampshire, or what he would call &ldquo;Upper
Wessex,&rdquo; the heart of his literary country is within the
easiest reach of its pleasant districts of villa residences, by
road or rail, or indeed by sea; for Swanage, the
&ldquo;Swanwich&rdquo; of a Hardy gazetteer, and Lulworth Cove,
his &ldquo;Lullstead,&rdquo; that azure pool within &ldquo;the
two projecting spurs of rock which form the pillars of Hercules
to this miniature Mediterranean,&rdquo; are the destinations in
summer of many steamboat voyages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandbourne has become a large place, they
say.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus Angel Clare, seeking his wife somewhere
within its bounds.&nbsp; Large indeed, and growing yet.&nbsp;
Census officials and other statisticians toil after its increase
in vain.&nbsp; I find a guide-book of 1887 speaking of its
population as &ldquo;nearly 18,000.&rdquo;&nbsp; I find another,
of 1896, putting it at &ldquo;about 40,000,&rdquo; and then
referring to the last census returns, discover it to have further
risen to forty-seven <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>thousand souls, and a few
over.&nbsp; By now it doubtless numbers full fifty thousand, and
has further rubricated and underscored its description in the
last pages of Tess: &ldquo;This fashionable watering-place with
its eastern and its western stations, its piers, its groves of
pines, its promenades, and its covered gardens, was to Angel
Clare like a fairy place, suddenly created by the stroke of a
wand, and allowed to get a little dusty.&nbsp; An outlying
eastern tract of the enormous Egdon waste was close at hand, yet
on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a
glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring
up.&nbsp; Within the space of a mile from its outskirts every
irregularity of the soil was prehistoric, every channel an
undisturbed British trackway; not a sod having been turned there
since the days of the C&aelig;sars.&nbsp; Yet the exotic had
grown here, suddenly as the prophet&rsquo;s gourd; and had drawn
hither Tess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding
ways of this new world in an old one, and could discern between
the trees and against the stars the lofty roofs, chimneys,
gazebos, and towers of the numerous fanciful residences of which
the place was composed.&nbsp; It was a city of detached mansions;
a Mediterranean lounging-place on the English Channel; and as
seen now by night it seemed even more imposing than it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea was near at hand, but not intrusive; it
murmured, and he thought it was the pines, the pines murmured in
precisely the same tones, and he thought they were the
sea.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>This rich and populous seaside home of wealthy valetudinarians
was until well on into the nineteenth <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>century a lonely waste, whose only
frequenters were smugglers, fishermen, rabbits, and
seagulls.&nbsp; In the midst of its pine-woods, sands, and
heather a little stream, the Bourne, which now gives this great
concourse of villa paradises, palatial hotels, and fashionable
shops its name, flowed into the sea, just where, in these days,
tricked out with cascades, and fountains, and made to wander
circuitously at the will of landscape-gardeners amid the neatest
of lawns and the gayest of flower-beds, it at last trickles
exhaustedly into the sea, under the pier.&nbsp; Its natural
course from the neighbourhood of Kinson, down Bourne Bottom, to
that smallest of &ldquo;mouths,&rdquo; is some six miles, but in
these days it is made to work hard in the last stretch, through
the public gardens, and where it once covered one mile, is now
looped here and turned back there upon itself, and exploited
generally, until it has become as sophisticated a stream as
anywhere to be found.&nbsp; The Bourne is, indeed, like the
humble parent of some overwhelming social success, made to alter
its ways and put aside its rustic manners, to do credit to its
offspring.</p>
<p>The country folk who live in the background of this oft-styled
&ldquo;City of Pines,&rdquo; still call it merely
&ldquo;Bourne,&rdquo; as it was when, many years ago, Dr.
Granville made the fortunes of the hamlet, frequented by a few
invalids and others rejoicing in the spicy odours of the
pine-woods, that had grown in a scattered and chance fashion upon
the heath.&nbsp; &ldquo;No situation,&rdquo; said that authority
upon spas and watering-places, &ldquo;possesses so many
capabilities of being made the very first sea watering-place in
England; and not only a watering-place, but what is still more <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>important,
a winter residence for the most delicate constitutions requiring
a warm and sheltered locality at this season of the
year.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then follow comparisons favourable to the site
of Bournemouth, and derogatory to other seaside resorts.</p>
<p>Every circumstance insured attention being drawn to this
weighty pronouncement, and advantage being taken of it.&nbsp;
Consumptives came and found the air beneficial, and Bournemouth
grew suddenly and astonishingly upon a lonely coastline; arising
in that residential all-round-the-calendar character it has kept
to this day, in spite of those holiday-folk, the excursionists
and trippers whom its &ldquo;residential&rdquo; stratum
discourages as much as possible.&nbsp; But when even so
thoroughly exclusive a residential health-resort has been so
successful, and has grown so greatly in that character as
Bournemouth has grown, there comes inevitably a time when the
workers and tradesfolk, ministrants to the wants of those
residents, themselves become an important section of the
community.&nbsp; It is a time when suburbs and quarters,
invidiously distinguished from one another in the social scale,
have established themselves; when, in short, from being just the
resort of a class, a place becomes a microcosm of life, in which
all classes and degrees are represented.&nbsp; The seal was set
upon the arrival of that time for Bournemouth with its admission
to the dignity of a municipal borough, fully equipped with Mayor
and Town Council, in the summer of 1890, and again, later, with
the opening of electric tramways.&nbsp; Railway-companies urge
the attractions of Bournemouth upon holiday-makers, with great
success, and nowadays one only perceives the <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>place in
anything like its former characteristic air at such time when the
summer has gone and the holiday-maker has returned to his own
fireside.</p>
<p>Bournemouth has already gathered together some odds and ends
of sentimental associations.&nbsp; Mary Wollstonecraft, widow of
Shelley, died here in 1853, and lies in the churchyard of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, beside Godwin and his wife, whose bodies were
brought from the London churchyard of St. Pancras.&nbsp; Keble
died here in 1866, and the present St. Peter&rsquo;s is his
memorial.&nbsp; Robert Louis Stevenson, Bournemouth&rsquo;s most
distinguished consumptive, resided at &ldquo;Skerryvore,&rdquo;
in Alum Chine Road, before he took flight to the South Seas.</p>
<p>But&mdash;singular and ungrateful omission&mdash;one looks in
vain for a statue to Dr. Granville, who, by his powerful
advocacy, made Bournemouth, just as Dr. Russel made Brighton a
century earlier.&nbsp; In this it is not difficult to find
another instance of &ldquo;benefits forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of a place so new as Bournemouth with one so
ancient as Poole is a piquant circumstance.&nbsp; When
Bournemouth rose, not like Britannia, from the azure main, but
from beside it, there was a considerable interval of open country
between the hoary seaport and the mint-new pleasure-town.&nbsp;
That interval has now shrunk to vanishing-point; for, what with
Bournemouth&rsquo;s expansion, growing Parkstone&rsquo;s position
midway, and Poole&rsquo;s own attempt to sprout in an eastwardly
direction, to meet those manifestations, the green country has
been abolished beneath an irruption of bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>The piquancy of Poole&rsquo;s ancient repose being <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>neighboured
by Bournemouth&rsquo;s wide-awake life is italicised when that
port&mdash;the &ldquo;Havenpool&rdquo; of <i>To Please his
Wife</i>&mdash;is entered.&nbsp; It would not be correct to say
that the days of Poole as a port are over, but with the growth in
size of modern ships, the shallowness of Poole Harbour in whose
recesses it is tucked rather obscurely away, prevents any but
vessels of slight draught coming up to its quays.&nbsp; For that
reason, large ocean-going steamers are strangers to Poole, more
familiar with wooden barques and brigantines and their maze of
masts and spars, than with the capacious steamships that,
although of much greater speed and tonnage, carry very slight and
insignificant sticks; and were it not for the china-clay
shipments and for that coasting trade which seems almost
indestructible, Poole would assuredly die.</p>
<p>But Poole, besides being ancient, has been a place to reckon
with.&nbsp; Already, in 1220, when by a proclamation of Henry
III. the ships of many ports were sealed up, Poole appeared among
the number.&nbsp; In 1347 its contribution towards the siege of
Calais was four ships and ninety-four men, and it was the base
from which the English army in France was provisioned.&nbsp; Then
in 1349 came that fourteenth century scourge, the Black Death,
and Poole, among other towns, was almost depopulated, and lost
the Parliamentary representation it had long enjoyed.&nbsp; But
it made a good recovery, and in the time of Henry VI. regained
its Parliamentary representation.&nbsp; Leland, writing of the
place describes it, two hundred years later, as &ldquo;a poore
fisshar village, much encreasid with fair building and use of
marchaundise of old tyme.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poole, after that <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>description
was penned, continued to recover itself, and fully regained its
lost prosperity.&nbsp; Fifty years later it is found carrying on
a thriving trade with Spain, and how truly it was said that its
merchants were men of wealth and consideration may be judged from
their large, and architecturally and decoratively fine, mansions
still remaining, although nowadays put to all kinds of mean uses
and often occupied as tenements.</p>
<p>Poole, however, long enjoyed a very bad reputation, and the
wealth of which these were some of the evidences, was not often
come by in very reputable ways.&nbsp; When it is said that Poole
&ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; a bad reputation, it is said advisedly, for
Poole was so lost to shame that it really <i>did</i> enjoy what
should have been a source of some searchings of heart.&nbsp; It
was a veritable nest of pirates and smugglers, and the home of
strange and original sinfulnesses; so that at last an injurious
rhyme that still survives was circulated about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If Poole were a fish-pool, and the men of
Poole fish,<br />
There&rsquo;d be a pool for the devil, and fish for his
dish.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So early as the close of the fourteenth century, the
buccaneers of Poole were infamous, and at their head was the
notorious Harry Page, known to the French and the Spaniards as
Arripay, the nearest they could frame to pronounce his
name.&nbsp; Arripay was a very full-blooded, enterprising, and
unscrupulous fellow; if without irreverence we may call him a
&ldquo;fellow,&rdquo; who was the admiral of his rascally
profession.&nbsp; There can be little doubt but that tradition
has added not a little to the tales of his exploits, and it is
hardly credible that he and his fellow-pirates should, on one <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>occasion,
have brought home a hundred and twenty prizes from the coast of
Brittany.&nbsp; His forays were made upon the shipping of the
foreigner, and with such system that no ship, it was said, could
successfully run the gauntlet of his lawless flotilla.&nbsp; His
success and power were so great that they necessitated the
sending of an expedition to sweep the seas of him.&nbsp; This was
an allied French and Spanish force, commissioned in 1406, and
sailing under the command of Perdo Nino, Count of Buelna.&nbsp;
Adopting the tactics of raiders, they burnt and ravaged the
coasts of Cornwall and Devon, and, coming to Dorset, swept into
Arripay&rsquo;s hornets&rsquo; nest of Poole Harbour, and landing
at Poole itself, defeated the townsmen in a pitched battle.&nbsp;
The brother of the redoubtable Arripay was among the slain.</p>
<p>A worthy successor of this bold spirit in the pike and cutlass
way&mdash;although he was no pirate, but just an honest stalwart
sailor&mdash;was that bonny fighter, Peter Jolliffe, of the hoy
<i>Sea Adventurer</i>.&nbsp; Off Swanage in 1694, he fell in with
a French privateer having a poor little captured Weymouth
fishing-smack in tow, and attacked the Frenchman repeatedly, and
at last with such success, that he not only released the smack,
but drove the privateer ashore near Lulworth, its crew being made
prisoners of war.&nbsp; For so signal an instance of bravery
Jolliffe received a gold chain and medal from the hands of the
king himself.</p>
<p>Jolliffe&rsquo;s example fired enthusiasm, and the following
year, William Thompson, skipper of a fishing-smack, aided only by
his scanty crew of one man and a boy, attacked a Cherbourg
privateer that had attempted to capture him, and actually
succeeded in capturing it and its complement of sixteen hands, <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>instead.&nbsp; He brought his prize into Poole, and he
too, fully deserved that gold chain and medal awarded him.</p>
<p>In St. James&rsquo;s church itself&mdash;disclosing an
interior not unlike that of a stern cabin of an old
man-o&rsquo;-war, writ large&mdash;is a monument to the intrepid
Jolliffe.&nbsp; From a reminiscence of it, no doubt, Mr. Hardy
chose to name Captain Shadrach Jolliffe, that shipmaster engaged
in the Newfoundland trade who is the ill-fated hero of <i>To
Please his Wife</i>.</p>
<p>For the rest, Poole figures so largely in the Civil War, as a
town ardently in favour of the Parliament, that it has a long and
stirring story of its own, in the varying fortunes of Roundheads
and Stuarts.&nbsp; It is too lengthy a story to be told with
advantage here.</p>
<p>The High Street of Poole, a mile long, is busy enough to quite
dispel any idea that Poole is not prospering; but, on the other
hand, the many puzzling narrow streets that lead out of it are so
rich in what have been noble residences, that they tell in
unmistakable tones of a greater period than this of to-day.</p>
<p>These byways lead at last past the church of St. Paul, the
fellow to St. James&rsquo;s, with its dolphin vane, to Poole
Quay, where the most prominent feature is an ancient Gothic
building, looking very like some desecrated place of worship, or
a monastic tithe-barn.&nbsp; It is, as a matter of fact, neither,
but the &ldquo;Town Cellar,&rdquo; a relic of a past age when
Poole was part of the manor of Canford.&nbsp; The lords of
Canford, away back to that ubiquitous John o&rsquo; Gaunt,
&ldquo;time-honoured Lancaster,&rdquo; who seems to have owned
quite half of the most desirable <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>properties in the England of his
time, took toll in money, when they could, and in kind when
silver marks and golden angels were scarce; and in the
&ldquo;Town Cellar&rdquo; were stored those bales of wool, those
spices from Ind, and those miscellaneous goods, which were made
in this manner to render unto the C&aelig;sars of Canford, in
times when such things were.&nbsp; It is a picturesque old
building, its walls oddly composed of flint intermingled with
large squared pieces of stone that, by the look of them, would
seem to have been plundered from some older structure.</p>
<p>Opposite stands the Harbour Office, not altogether
unpicturesquely provided with a loggia supported by columns, and
still retaining the sundial erected when clocks were
scarce.&nbsp; The Mayor of Poole, who in 1727 presided over the
fortunes of the port, is handed down to posterity by the quaint
tablet let into the gable wall, showing us the quarter-length
relief portrait of a stout personage in voluminous wig and
mayoral chain and robes, lackadaisically glancing skyward, as
though longing to be gone to those ethereal regions where double
chins and &ldquo;too, too solid flesh&rdquo; are not.</p>
<p>Poole Quay&mdash;its old buildings, waterside picturesqueness,
and the shipping lying off the walls&mdash;is an interesting
place for the artist, who has it very much to himself; for the
holiday-maker does not often discover it.&nbsp; But waterside
characters are not lacking: sailors, who have got berths and are
only waiting for the tide to serve; other sailors, who are in
want of berths; town boys, who would dearly like to go to sea;
and nondescript characters, who would not take a job if offered
to them, and want nothing but a quayside bollard to sit upon,
sunshine, a pipe of <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>tobacco, and the price of half a
pint: these form the natural history of Poole Quay, which though
it may have been&mdash;and was&mdash;one of the gateways into the
great outer world, in the brave old days of Arripay and his merry
men, is now something of a straitened gate, and Poole itself for
the land voyager very much in the nature of one of those
stop-blocks at the end of a railway siding: what a railway man
would call a &ldquo;dead end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Poole is not a main road to anywhere, and when you have
turned down into it, on those three and a half miles from
Bournemouth, you are either compelled to return the way you came,
or else cross a creek by the toll-bridge to Hamworthy, where
there is nothing but a church built in 1826&mdash;and precisely
of the nature one might expect from that date&mdash;and, a little
way onward, a lonely railway junction in midst of sandy heaths
and whispering pines, which, even at night, &ldquo;tell the tale
of their species,&rdquo; as phrenologists say, &ldquo;without
help from outline or colour,&rdquo; in &ldquo;those melancholy
moans and sobs which give to their sound a solemn sadness
surpassing even that of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the district
of <i>The Hand of Ethelberta</i>, and if we pursue it, we shall,
as Sol says, in that novel, &ldquo;come to no place for two or
three miles, and then only to Flychett,&rdquo; which, in everyday
life, is Lytchett Minster, a place which, despite that grand
name, can show nothing in the nature of a cathedral, and is, as
Sol said, &ldquo;a trumpery small bit of a village,&rdquo; where
possibly that wheelwright mentioned in the story still
&ldquo;keeps a beer-house and owns two horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
house is the inn oddly named the &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s
Finger,&rdquo; with a picture-sign standing on a post by the
wayside, and <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>showing St. Peter holding up a hand with two extended
fingers in benedictory fashion, as though blessing the
wayfarer.&nbsp; The origin of this sign is said to be the custom,
once usual in Roman Catholic times, of holding manorial courts on
Lammas Day, the 1st of August, the day of St. Peter ad
Vincula&mdash;that St. Peter-in-the-Fetters to whom the church on
Tower Green, in the Tower of London, is so appropriately
dedicated.&nbsp; On that day suit and service had to be performed
by tenants for their lands, which thus obtained, in course of
time, the corrupted title of &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s Finger&rdquo;
property.</p>
<p>Around the village so slightingly characterised in <i>The Hand
of Ethelberta</i> there is little save &ldquo;the everlasting
heath,&rdquo; mentioned in that story, &ldquo;the black hills
bulging against the sky, the barrows upon their round summits
like warts on a swarthy skin.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is true the road
leads at last to Bere Regis, but it has little individuality and
no further Hardyesque significance, and so may be disregarded in
these pages.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WIMBORNE
MINSTER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wimborne Minster</span> or
&ldquo;Warborne&rdquo; in <i>Two on a Tower</i>&mdash;is, or was,
for the Romans and their works are altogether vanished from the
town, the <i>Vindogladia</i> of the Antonine Itinerary.&nbsp; If
you speak of it in the curt irreverent way of railways and their
time-tables, or in the equally curt, but only familiar, manner of
its inhabitants, it is merely &ldquo;Wimborne.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
their mouths, elision of the &ldquo;Minster&rdquo; merely
connotes affection and use, as one drops the titles or the
&ldquo;Mister&rdquo; of a friend, in speaking of him; but in the
case of railway usage it is the offensive familiarity of the
ill-bred, or, at the least, a derogatory saving of space and
type.</p>
<p>This common practice is all the more historically an outrage,
for had there been no Minster, there would have been no town of
Wimborne.&nbsp; It derives from an early religious settlement,
founded in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 700 near the site
of the forgotten Roman station, by Cuthburga, one of those
unsatisfactory princess spouses of the pietistic period of Saxon
dominion, who, married to the King of Northumbria, refused him
conjugal rights and finally established herself here, living a
life of &ldquo;continual watchings and fastings,&rdquo; and
finally dying of them.&nbsp; <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>We are not concerned to follow the
mazes of the early history of town and church.&nbsp; It suffered
the usual plunderings and burnings, the nuns were occasionally
carried off, sometimes against their will, at other times with
their consent, and at last, somewhere about <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 902, monks replaced them.&nbsp; The
whole foundation was re-established by Edward the Confessor, and
remained as a Collegiate church until 1547, when it was
disestablished, its revenues seized, and the building wholly
converted to the purposes of a parish church.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Wimborne Minster might be made the subject of a lengthy
architectural disquisition.&nbsp; Its two towers, western and
central, are themselves pointers to its history; for they show,
not in the different periods at which they were built, but in the
richness of the one and the comparative plainness of the other,
the combined uses of the building in days of old.&nbsp; The
central tower, of transitional Norman design, and remarkably like
the towers of Exeter cathedral, was originally surmounted by a
stone spire, which fell in 1600.&nbsp; Its elaboration is
explained by its having been a part of the monastic church, while
the western tower erected about 1460, belonged to the parochial
building.</p>
<p>The church, endowed with two&mdash;and two
dissimilar&mdash;towers, is a splendid feature in the streets of
the old town.&nbsp; It and the town gain dignity and interest in
an amazing degree, and here in Wimborne the pinnacled
battlemented outlines &ldquo;make&rdquo; both town and Minster,
in the pictorial sense.&nbsp; They bulk darkly and largely across
the yellow sandiness of the broad market-place, and sort
themselves into endless and changeful combinations down the <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>narrower
streets.&nbsp; Apart, too, from these important considerations,
the Minster is exceptionally rich in curious features, outside
its architectural details.</p>
<p>Our ancestors possessed a quaint mixture of serious devotion
and light-hearted childishness, and we are the richer for
it.&nbsp; Thus, high up on the external wall of the western
tower, the observant will notice the odd little effigy, carved,
painted and gilt, resembling a grenadier of a century ago, or a
French gendarme of a past <i>r&eacute;gime</i>: it is difficult
to assign it with certainty, and assuredly it does not look so
old as 1600, the date when it is stated to have been placed
here.&nbsp; His business is that of a quarter-jack, and he
strikes the quarters upon a bell on either side of him.&nbsp; The
clock within, an astronomical contrivance made in 1320 by that
same ingenious Glastonbury monk, Peter Lightfoot, who was the
author of the famous clock of Wells Cathedral, represents the
courses of the sun, moon, and stars.</p>
<p>The Minster, in short, is a museum of antiquities, found
particularly interesting by the half-day excursionists from
Bournemouth who are its chief visitors and carry away a fine
confused recollection of their scamper round it.&nbsp; Here, in a
room above the vestry, is the Chained Library, a collection of
over two hundred and forty volumes, mostly chained to iron
rods.&nbsp; Some of the books are very early, but the collection
was formed in 1686.&nbsp; Perhaps, for the sake of its story, the
copy of Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the
World&rdquo; is even more interesting than &ldquo;The Whole Duty
of Man&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Breeches Bible,&rdquo; for it still
displays the carefully mended hundred leaves burnt through when
<a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>the boy,
afterwards poet, Prior fell asleep over his reading of it and
upset the candle, with this result.&nbsp; Each damaged page was
neatly mended by him and the missing letters so carefully
restored that it is difficult, until attention is drawn to the
repair, to detect anything exceptional.&nbsp; Prior was born at
Wimborne in 1664, as a brass tablet in the western tower to his
&ldquo;perennial and fragrant&rdquo; memory tells us.</p>

</a>But of paramount interest to sightseers, far transcending the
ironbound deed-chests, some hollowed from a single trunk, and the
tombs of the noble and knightly, is the last resting-place of
Anthony Etricke, in the south wall of the choir aisle.&nbsp;
Anthony Etricke was a personage of some local distinction in his
day, for besides being a man of wealth, he was first Recorder of
Poole.&nbsp; He has also won a little niche in the history of
England by no effort of his own: a distinction thrust upon him by
circumstance, and one which might have fallen upon any other
local magistrate.&nbsp; Sentimentally speaking, it is also a
wholly invidious and undesirable fame or notoriety, and was so
regarded by the good folk of the town.&nbsp; Etricke, residing at
Holt, near the spot where the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth was
captured, was the magistrate before whom the wretched fugitive
was brought.&nbsp; Another might possibly, greatly daring, have
secured the escape of that romantic figure, and <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>by so doing
at the same time have altered the course of English history and
earned the admiration of those who admire chivalric deeds.&nbsp;
But Etricke was not of this stamp, and was, moreover, of that old
faith which the bigoted James was striving to reintroduce: while
Monmouth was the Protestant champion.&nbsp; Alas! poor
champion.&nbsp; Etricke at once performed his bounden duty as a
magistrate, and also satisfied his own private feelings; and
Monmouth ended miserably.</p>
<p>Etricke never regained popularity in his district, and lived
for eighteen years longer, a shunned and soured man.&nbsp; The
story tells how he took what may surely be regarded as the odd
and altogether insufficient revenge of declaring that he would be
buried neither in the church of Wimborne nor out of it, and
accordingly in his lifetime had a niche prepared here, in the
wall, where the polished black slate sarcophagus, still seen
above ground, was placed.&nbsp; He was eccentric beyond this, for
he had conceived the date of his death and caused it to be boldly
carved on the side, between two of the seven shields of arms that
in braggart fashion are made to redound to the glory of the
Etricke family.&nbsp; That year he had imagined would be 1691,
but he actually survived until 1703, and the date was accordingly
altered (as seen to this day) when at last, to the satisfaction
of Wimborne, he did demise.&nbsp; For the keeping of his tomb in
good repair he left twenty shillings annually, a sum still
administered by the Charity Commissioners; and it certainly
cannot be said that he does not receive value for his money,
because his eccentric lair is maintained, heraldic cognisances
and all, in the most perfect condition.&nbsp; <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>Any
ill-will this solemn personage may have felt towards Wimborne is
altogether robbed of satisfaction nowadays, and his gloomy ghost
may, for all we know, be enraged at the thought of the attraction
his eccentricity has for visitors and the trade in photographs it
has provoked, much to the material well-being of the town.</p>

<p>The pilgrim of the Hardy country, come to Wimborne&mdash;I
should have said &ldquo;Warborne&rdquo;&mdash;to see that Grammar
School where, to quote Haymoss Fry, &ldquo;they draw up young
gam&rsquo;sters&rsquo; brains like rhubarb under a ninepenny pan,
my lady, excusing my common way,&rdquo; is like to be
disappointed, for the place where &ldquo;they hit so much larning
into en that &rsquo;a could talk like the day of Pentecost&rdquo;
is no longer an ancient building.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, the
foundation is what the country folk might call an &ldquo;old
arnshunt&rdquo; thing enough, being the work indeed of that very
great founder of schools and colleges, the Lady Margaret,
Countess of Richmond, mother of Henry VII.&nbsp; It was refounded
by Queen Elizabeth, who stripped all the credit of this good deed
in a naughty world from the memory of the pious countess, and
willed that it should be styled &ldquo;The Grammar School of the
Foundation of Queen Elizabeth in Wimborne Minster in the County
of Dorset.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was pretty bad, but worse came with
the whirling years.&nbsp; James I., like the shabby fellow he
was, raised a question respecting the validity of its charter,
and was only bought off with &pound;600; and Charles I., unlike
the noble, magnanimous sovereign he is commonly thought to be,
bled the institution to the tune of another &pound;1,000, by a
similar dodge.&nbsp; The wonder is that it has survived <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>at all, and
not only survived, but flourished and was able, so long ago as
1851, to build itself that new and substantial home which is so
scholastically useful, but at the same time disappointing to the
literary pilgrim who, at the place where Swithin St. Cleeve was
educated, hoped to find a picturesque building of medi&aelig;val
age.</p>
<h2><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WIMBORNE MINSTER TO
SHAFTESBURY</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wimborne</span> shall here be the
starting-point of a twenty-eight miles route, that in its
south-easterly to north-westerly direction, is as easy as the one
north to south of the road between Sherborne and Weymouth.&nbsp;
It follows the valley of the Stour the whole way, and only at its
conclusion brings up butt against the hill on which Shaftesbury
is built.</p>
<p>There is at the outset from Wimborne a choice between the
easeful and the toilsome.&nbsp; You may elect to go directly
up-along, to the height frowned down upon by the greater height
of Badbury Rings, or may go more circuitously but by more level
ways, through Corfe Mullen and Sturminster Marshall.&nbsp; On the
first route, beautifully overhung by elms, lies Kingston Lacy,
the old seat of the Bankes family, rebuilt by Sir Ralph Bankes in
1663, and now a very treasure-house of art and historic
relics.&nbsp; Here one may, greatly favoured, see and touch those
keys of Corfe Castle, held so stoutly by the valorous Lady Bankes
in the two sieges she withstood.</p>
<p>A younger avenue of beeches lines the exposed road across the
shoulders of what has been identified as <i>Mons
Badonicus</i>&mdash;Badbury Rings&mdash;the scene of the
overwhelming victory gained in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
520, over <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>Cerdic and his Saxons by King Arthur and his
Britons.&nbsp; In later years, when at last Saxon dominion had
spread, and this had become Wessex, Saxons themselves encamped
where of old they had been defeated, and after them the Danes
occupied this inhospitable height.&nbsp; It is now tufted with a
clump of fir-trees, and, solemn and darkly looming against a
lowering sky, looks a fitting scene for any national portent of
evil.</p>
<p>They are less impressive roads that lead by the Stour to Corfe
Mullen and Sturminster Marshall.&nbsp; There the farmer reaps his
heavy crops of hay and cereals, and ploughs and sows and reaps
again, and history is only a matter of comparison between this
year of a poor harvest, when prices are high and marketable
produce little, and last year of a bumper, when the horn of Ceres
was full and prices low.&nbsp; No matter what the yield, there is
ever a something to dash the farmer&rsquo;s cup from his
expectant lips.</p>
<p>At Bailey Corner, three miles from Wimborne, a broad main road
branches off from our route, going to Bere Regis and
Dorchester.&nbsp; This is the road made at the suggestion of Mr.
Erle-Drax of Charborough Park, whose property, it may be
supposed, gained in some way from it.&nbsp; Charborough Park is
one of the originals whence Welland House and the tower of <i>Two
on a Tower</i> were drawn, and therefore demands a deviation of
two miles from our route.</p>
<p>It is a straight road and a lonely that leads to the main
entrance-lodge of this seat of the Erle-Drax family, past a
long-continued brick boundary-wall that must have cost a small
fortune, and decorated at intervals with arches surmounted by
effigies of <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>stags and lions.&nbsp; Time has dealt very severely
with some of the squire&rsquo;s stags, shorn here and there of a
limb, and in one instance presenting a headless awfulness to the
gaze of the pilgrim, who can scarce repress a shudder at sight of
it, even though the destruction provides a little comedy of its
own, in the revelation that these imposing &ldquo;stone&rdquo;
decorations are really of plaster, and hollow.</p>
<p>The principal entrance to Charborough Park, the one feature
that breaks the long, straight perspective of this undeviating
road, seems to have been erected by the squire as a species of
permanent self-advertising hoarding, for it is boldly inscribed:
&ldquo;This road from Wimborne to Dorchester was projected and
completed through the instrumentality of J. S. W. Sawbridge
Erle-Drax, Esq., M.P., in the years 1841 and 1842.&rdquo;&nbsp;
C&aelig;sar himself could have done no more than was performed by
this magnate of the many names, and could not with greater
magnificence have suppressed the fact that what his Parliamentary
influence procured, the public purse paid for.</p>
<p>There is this essential difference between Charborough Park
and &ldquo;Welland House.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charborough is very
closely guarded from intrusion, and none who cannot show a real
reason for entering is allowed through the jealously closed and
locked gates of the lodges.</p>
<p>The residence of Lady Constantine was, however, very readily
accessible, and, &ldquo;as is occasionally the case with
old-fashioned manors, possessed none of the exclusiveness found
in some aristocratic settlements.&nbsp; The parishioners looked
upon the park avenue as their natural thoroughfare, particularly
for christenings, weddings, and funerals, which passed <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>the
squire&rsquo;s mansion, with due considerations as to the scenic
effect of the same from the manor windows.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much
to show the composite nature of the scene drawn in <i>Two on a
Tower</i>.</p>
<p>The tower&mdash;the &ldquo;Rings Hill Speer&rdquo; of the
story&mdash;stands in the park, at a considerable distance from
the house on the other side of a gentle dip, but well within
sight of the drawing-room windows.&nbsp; In between, across the
turf and disappearing into the woodlands to right and left, roam
the deer that so plentifully inhabit this beautiful domain.&nbsp;
The tower is approached by roomy stone staircases, now overgrown
with grass, moss, and fungi, and so far from it or its approaches
being in &ldquo;the Tuscan order of architecture,&rdquo; they are
designed in a most distinctive and aggressive Strawberry Hill
Gothic manner.&nbsp; Built originally by Major Drax in 1796, and
struck by lightning, it was rebuilt in 1839.</p>
<p>Returning now from this interlude and regaining Bailey Corner,
we come to Sturminster Marshall, a place that now, for all the
dignity of its name, is just a rustic village, with only that
name and an ancient church that was the &ldquo;Stour
Minster&rdquo; of the Earls of Pembroke, the Earls Marshal of
England, to affirm its vanished importance.&nbsp; Its village
green, bordered with scattered cottages, has a maypole, painted,
like a barber&rsquo;s pole, with vivid bands of red, white, and
blue.</p>
<p>An expedition from this point, across the Stour to Shapwick,
although a roundabout pilgrimage, is not likely to be an
unrewarded exertion, for that is a village which, although
unknown to the greater world, has a local fame that, so long as
<a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>rustic
satire lives, will assuredly not be allowed to die.</p>

</a>Shapwick is not remote from the sea, but it might be a
midland village (and exceptionally ignorant at that) if we are to
believe the legend which accounts for the local name of
&ldquo;Shapwick Wheel-offs,&rdquo; by which its villagers are
known.&nbsp; According to this injurious tale, a shepherd,
watching his sheep on Shapwick Down at some period
unspecified&mdash;let us call it, as the children do, &ldquo;once
upon a time,&rdquo; or &ldquo;ever so long ago&rdquo;&mdash;found
a live crab, or lobster, that had fallen out of an itinerant
fishmonger&rsquo;s cart.&nbsp; He was so alarmed at the sight of
the strange thing that he hurried into the village with the news
of it, and brought all the people out to see.&nbsp; With them was
the oldest inhabitant, a &ldquo;tar&rsquo;ble wold man,&rdquo;
incapable of locomotion, brought in a wheelbarrow to pronounce,
out of the wisdom his accumulated years gave him, what this
unknown <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>monster might be.&nbsp; When his ancient eyes lighted
upon it, or rather, in the Do&rsquo;set speech: &ldquo;When a sin
&rsquo;en, a carled out, tar&rsquo;ble feared on &rsquo;en,
&lsquo;wheel I off, my sonnies, wheel I off.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
So they wheeled him off, accordingly, well pleased to leave that
mysterious thing to itself.</p>
<p>As may well be supposed, the Shapwick folk are by no means
proud of their nickname, and it is therefore a little surprising
to find an old and very elaborate weathervane in the village,
surmounting the roof of a barn, and giving, in a quaintly
silhouetted group, a pictorial representation of the scene.&nbsp;
It seems that there were originally three more figures, behind
the barrow, but they have disappeared.&nbsp; Perhaps this is
evidence of attempts on the part of Shapwick folk to destroy the
record of their shame.</p>
<p>A succession of pretty villages&mdash;Spetisbury, Charlton
Marshall, Blandford St. Mary&mdash;enlivens the five miles of
road between Sturminster Marshall and Blandford; and then
Blandford itself, already described, is entered.&nbsp; Passing
through it, and skirting the grounds of Bryanstone, the Stour,
more beautiful than earlier on the route, is crossed, and the
twin villages of Durweston and Stourpaine, one on either bank,
are glimpsed.&nbsp; Then comes the large village of
Shillingstone, still steadfastly rural, despite its size, and
keeping to the ancient ways more markedly than Sturminster
Marshall, for it not only shares with that village the
peculiarity of owning a maypole, but a maypole of exceptional
height, and one still dressed and decorated with every
spring.&nbsp; This tall pole, tapering like the mast of a ship,
<a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>is a
hundred and ten feet in height, and most carefully guarded with
wire stays against destruction by the stormy winds that in winter
sweep down the valley of the Stour.</p>

</a></p>
<p>If we were to name the Shillingstone maypole in accordance
with the date of its annual garlanding, it would rather be a
&ldquo;Junepole,&rdquo; for it is on the 9th of that month that
the pretty old ceremony and its attendant merrymakings are
held.&nbsp; This apparently arbitrary selection of a date is
explained by the old May Day games and rejoicings having been
held on May 29th, in the years after the Restoration of Charles
II. in 1660; and by the change from Old Style to New, more than a
hundred and fifty years later.&nbsp; That change, taking away
eleven days, converted what would have been May 29th into June
9th; and thus by gradual change this survival of the ancient
pagan festival <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>of Floralia is held when May Day has itself passed and
become a memory.</p>
<p>The pole has several times been restored.&nbsp; Its present
appearance is due to the restoration of October 1868, but the
arrow vane with which it was then surmounted appears to have been
blown down, and its improving mottoes&mdash;&ldquo;Tanquam
sagitta&rdquo; (Like as an arrow), and &ldquo;Sic et nos&rdquo;
(So even we)&mdash;lost.&nbsp; Another Latin inscription is
Englished thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their maypole, decayed by age, the rector and
inhabitants of Shillingstone, keeping their yearly May Games with
all due observance, have carefully restored it on the ninth day
of June 1850:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fading garland mourns how short
life&rsquo;s day,<br />
The towering maypole heavenward points the way.<br />
Read thou the lesson&mdash;seek to gather now<br />
Undying wreaths to twine a deathless brow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All very pious and proper, no doubt, but wofully lacking in
the May Day spirit of the joy of life, and more fitting to the
&ldquo;Memento mori&rdquo; fashion of the neighbouring
churchyard.</p>
<p>In this old church of Shillingstone&mdash;or
&ldquo;Shilling-Okeford,&rdquo; as from the old manorial lords it
was once named&mdash;the pilgrim may see by the evidence of an
old tablet how a certain William Keen, a merchant of London,
fleeing terror-struck from the Great Plague, was overtaken by it
and died here in 1666.</p>
<p>The reader, versed in the oddities of place-names, will
perhaps not require the assurance that the name of Shillingstone
has nothing whatever to do with shillings; but if he doubts, let
it at once be said that it was so called long before that coin
was known.&nbsp; It was originally &ldquo;Oakford&rdquo; and <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>became
&ldquo;Schelin&rsquo;s Oakford,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Schelin&rsquo;s
Town,&rdquo; when the manor was in Norman times given to an
ancestor of those who for centuries later continued to hold it
and in more elaborate fashion styled themselves Eschellings.</p>

<p>Down over intervening hills the road, for a little space
forsaking its character of a valley route, comes beside the
stream again at Piddleford&mdash;or, as the Post Office
authorities prefer to call it &ldquo;Fiddleford&rdquo;&mdash;on
the way to Sturminster Newton, the &ldquo;Stourcastle&rdquo; of
<i>Tess</i>.&nbsp; This is the place mentioned at the opening of

Marnhull at night, <a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

</a></p>
<p>Of Sturminster Newton, impressively styled on ordnance maps
&ldquo;Sturminster Newton Castle,&rdquo; Leland says: &ldquo;The
townlette is no greate thing, and the building of it is
mene,&rdquo; and, although it would not occur to a modern writer
to adopt that term, certainly there is little that is notable
about it.&nbsp; There is no &ldquo;minster,&rdquo; no
&ldquo;castle,&rdquo; and no &ldquo;new town,&rdquo; and little
to say, save that an ancient six-arched bridge crosses the weedy
Stour and that the battered stump of the market cross in the main
street seems in its decay to typify the history of the <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>market
itself.&nbsp; As the church has been rebuilt, and as the castle
on the outskirts is now little more than a memory, the only
resort is to turn for some point of interest to that quaintly
thatched old inn, the White Hart, very much older than the
tablet, &ldquo;W. M. P. 1708,&rdquo; on its front would lead many
to suppose.&nbsp; It was probably restored at that date, after
those troublous times had passed in which the cross, just
opposite, lost its shaft, and when, in the fighting in the
streets between the Parliamentary dragoons and the associated
clubmen of the west, this house and others were fired and
Sturminster Newton very generally given over to the horrors of a
brutal conflict between troops trained to arms and a peasantry
unskilled in the use of the weapons with which they had hastily
equipped themselves.&nbsp; But, unprofessional soldiers though
they were, the clubmen at Sturminster gave an excellent account
of themselves, killing and wounding a number of the dragoons, and
taking sixteen others prisoners.</p>

(<i>continued</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Onwards</span> from Sturminster Newton the
road comes into the rich Vale of Blackmore and traverses levels
watered by the Lidden, in addition to the Stour.&nbsp; Turning
here to the right-hand and avoiding the way to Stalbridge, we
follow the steps of Tess to her home at &ldquo;Marlott,&rdquo; a
village to be identified with Marnhull.</p>
<p>Could we associate any cottage here with the birthplace of
Tess, how interesting a landmark that would be!&nbsp; But it is
not to be done.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rolliver&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Pure Drop&rdquo; inn, may be the &ldquo;Crown,&rdquo; but
you who call there to wet a particularly dry whistle on a
scorching day will not find the name of Rolliver over the door,
either of this house or of another, with the picture-sign of a
dashing hussar outside.&nbsp; As to whether either or both of
them keep &ldquo;a pretty brew,&rdquo; as we are told
Rolliver&rsquo;s did, I cannot tell you, for when dry, I drink
ginger-beer if it is to be got, and, if it isn&rsquo;t, go
thirsty, refusing alike malt-liquors and the abominable gaseous
compounds made cheaply of harmful materials, sold expensively,
and rather thirst-provoking than quenching.</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>Marnhull is not precisely the type of village the
readers of <i>Tess</i> would picture as the home of a heroine
whose adventures have so constant a background of dairying.&nbsp;
It is, or was, a quarry-village, and the shallow pits that
supplied for stone the church and the cottages are still
prominent in a field to the left of the road to
Shaftesbury.&nbsp; Thus Marnhull is somewhat formal and prim, and
instead of the abundant thatch noticeable in the typical villages
of dairy farms, its houses are roofed with slates and tiles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image289" href="images/p289.jpg">
<img alt=
"Marnhull"
title=
"Marnhull"
 src="images/p289.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The church of Marnhull has a singularly fine tower, which,
although the details of its Perpendicular design are largely
intermingled with Renaissance ornament, is in general outline a
beautiful and imposing specimen of Gothic, built in that
period&mdash;the early eighteenth century&mdash;generally thought
impossible for Gothic art.&nbsp; It was in <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>1718 that
this fine work arose out of the heap of ruins into which the old
tower had suddenly fallen, but it has almost every appearance of
being three hundred years older, and it seems likely that, as it
now stands, it was a free copy of its predecessor.</p>
<p>The body of the church is of much earlier date, and well
supplied with medi&aelig;val effigies and finely carved capitals
to its pillars.&nbsp; But it is not without amusement that one
reads the flamboyant epitaph to the Reverend Mr. Conyers Place,
M.A.,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;the youngeft son of an ancient and
reputable family in the County of York, who, after he had been
liberally educated at Trinity College, in Cambridge, was invited
to the Mafter-fhip of the Grammar School in Dorchester, which he
governed many years with great succefs and applaufe till, weary
of the fatigue of it, he chofe to refign it.&nbsp; He was endowed
with many excellent talents, both natural and acquired: a lively
wit, a sound judgement, with solid and extenfive learning: he was
eminently Studious, yet remarkably facetious: attached to no
party, nor addicted to any caufe but that of Truth and Religion,
in the defence of whofe Doctrines he wrote many learned and
ingenious Treatifes; while he was efteemed by all worthy of the
greateft Preferments, he lived content with the praife of
deferving without enjoying any but the small Rectory of Poxwell,
in this County, which he held two years, and in the Pofsefsion of
which he died.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shaftesbury, six miles onward from Marnhull, is soon seen,
standing as it does majestically upon a commanding hill.&nbsp; It
looks perhaps best from the point where the old farmstead of
Blynfield <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>stands, at the foot of the long and winding ascent,
whence you see the hillside common stretching up to the very edge
of the town.&nbsp; From distant points such as this,
&ldquo;Shaston,&rdquo; as Mr. Hardy, the milestones, and old
chroniclers agree to call it, wears the look of another Jerusalem
the Golden, and any who, thus looking upon this town of old
romance, should chance to come no nearer, might well carry away
an impression of a fairy city whose architecture was equal to
both its half-legendary history and its natural
surroundings.&nbsp; If such a traveller there be, let him rest
assured that nothing in Shaftesbury, saving only the view over
limitless miles of Vale, stretching away into the distance, is
worth the climbing up to it, and that to make its near and
intimate acquaintance is only to dispel that distant dream of an
unearthly beauty which afar off seems to belong to it.</p>
<p>Shaftesbury&rsquo;s streets are in fact more than ordinarily
commonplace, and its houses grossly tasteless.&nbsp; It is as
though, despairing of ever bringing Shaftesbury back to a shadow
of the magnificence of history and architecture it once enjoyed,
the builders of the modern town built houses as plastiferously
ugly as they could.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shaston&rdquo; is described with
a wonderful sympathy and lightness of touch by Mr.
Hardy:&mdash;&ldquo;The ancient British Palladour was, and is, in
itself the city of a dream.&nbsp; Vague imaginings of its castle,
its three mints, its magnificent apsidal abbey, the chief glory
of South Wessex, its twelve churches, its shrines, chantries,
hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions&mdash;all now ruthlessly
swept away&mdash;throw the visitor, even against his will, into a
pensive melancholy, <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>which the stimulating atmosphere and
limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel.&nbsp; The
spot was the burial-place of a king and a queen, of abbots and
abbesses, saints and bishops, knights and squires.&nbsp; The
bones of King Edward &lsquo;the Martyr,&rsquo; carefully removed
thither for holy preservation, brought Shaston a renown which
made it the resort of pilgrims from every part of Europe, and
enabled it to maintain a reputation extending far beyond English
shores.&nbsp; To this fair creation of the great Middle Ages the
Dissolution was, as historians tell us, the death-knell.&nbsp;
With the destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place
collapsed in a general ruin; the martyr&rsquo;s bones met with
the fate of the sacred pile that held them, and not a stone is
now left to tell where they lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town
still remain; but, strange to say, these qualities, which were
noted by many writers in ages when scenic beauty is said to have
been unappreciated, are passed over in this, and one of the
queerest and quaintest spots in England stands virtually
unvisited to-day.&nbsp; It has a unique position on the summit of
an almost perpendicular scarp, rising on the north, south and
west sides of the borough out of the deep alluvial Vale of
Blackmoor, the view from the Castle Green over three counties of
verdant pasture&mdash;South, Mid, and Nether Wessex&mdash;being
as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller&rsquo;s eyes as
the medicinal air is to his lungs.&nbsp; Impossible by a railway,
it can best be reached on foot, next best by light vehicles; and
it is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the
north-east, that connects it with the high chalk table-land on
that <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>side.&nbsp; Such is, and such was, the now-forgotten
Shaston or Palladour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That finely inaccurate chronicler, or rather romancer,
Geoffrey of Monmouth, who never lacked &ldquo;historical&rdquo;
details while his imagination remained in good preservation, has
some picturesque &ldquo;facts&rdquo; to narrate of
Shaftesbury.&nbsp; It was founded, says he, by Hudibras,
grandfather of King Lear, a trifle of 950 years before the
Christian era.&nbsp; Between that shamelessly absurd origin and
the earliest known mention of the place, in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 880, when Alfred the Great founded a
nunnery here, there is thus a gulf&mdash;a very yawning gulf,
too&mdash;of one thousand, eight hundred and thirty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caer Palladour,&rdquo; as it had been in early British
times, became &ldquo;Edwardstow&rdquo; when, in the year 979, the
body of the young king &ldquo;martyred&rdquo; at Corfe Castle was
translated from its resting-place at Wareham, but although his
shrine was the scene of many miracles and greatly resorted to, we
do not find that change of name so greatly favoured as was the
like change made in East Anglia, when, early in the eleventh
century, the town that had been Beodric&rsquo;s Weorth became,
with the miracle-mongering of St. Edmund&rsquo;s shrine, that
town of St. Edmundsbury which we know as Bury St. Edmunds.&nbsp;
No: as the expressive modern slang would phrase it, the name of
&ldquo;Edwardstow&rdquo; never really &ldquo;caught on,&rdquo;
and Caer Palladour, which had in the beginning of Saxon rule
become &ldquo;Shaftesbyrig,&rdquo; has so remained.</p>
<p>Nowadays the only vestiges of the great Abbey of Shaftesbury
are the fragments of encaustic tiles and carved stones, rarely
and with difficulty brought to light by antiquarian societies,
painfully digging <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>on the spot once occupied by it; and the great abbey
estates, the booty at the Dissolution seized by, or granted to,
Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, now belong to the Duke of
Westminster, whose Grosvenor crest of a wheatsheaf is prominent
in the town.</p>
<p>There are three parish churches at Shaftesbury; St.
James&rsquo;s, as you climb upwards towards the town, and Holy
Trinity and St. Peter&rsquo;s in the town itself.&nbsp; It is St.
Peter&rsquo;s which is seen in the illustration of Gold Hill, by
whose incredibly steep ascent the pilgrim takes his way up from
the deep recesses of the Vale.&nbsp; This is the most difficult
approach, paved with granite setts divided off into broad steps,
so that in wet weather the hillside shall not slip away into
those depths; and with the craggy sides shored up by ancient
stone buttresses of prodigious bulk.&nbsp; The building that
closes in the view next the church tower, leaving but a narrow
entrance alley into the town, is the Town Hall and Market
House.</p>
<p>There are, of course, wider and less steep entrances to
Shaftesbury, but this shows it on its most characteristic
side.</p>
<p>Shaftesbury is chiefly associated in the pages of the Wessex
novels with <i>Jude the Obscure</i>, for here it was that the
long-suffering and inoffensive Phillotson&mdash;who (why?) always
reminds me of Wordsworth&mdash;obtained the school, which he and
the distracting Sue were to jointly keep.&nbsp; Their house,
&ldquo;Old Grove&rsquo;s Place,&rdquo; is easily
recognisable.&nbsp; You come to it past Bimport, near the fork of
the roads that run severally to Motcombe and to East Stower, on
the edge of the plateau.&nbsp; It is an old house with projecting
porch and mullioned windows <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>through which it would be quite
easy, as in the story, to see the movements of any one inside;
and the upper room over the entrance is not too high above the
pavement for any one who, like Sue, leaped from the window, to
alight without injury.&nbsp; <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>Those people are probably few who
feel an oppressiveness in old houses such as that which worried
the highly strung and neurotic Sue Bridehead: &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t live in the school, you know,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;but in that ancient dwelling across the way called Old
Grove&rsquo;s Place.&nbsp; It is so antique and dismal that it
depresses me dreadfully.&nbsp; Such houses are very well to
visit, but not to live in.&nbsp; I feel crushed into the earth by
the weight of so many previous lives there spent.&nbsp; In a new
place like these schools, there is only your own life to
support.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Close by are the schools.&nbsp; Looking upon them the more
than usually sentimental pilgrim, with, it may be, some ancient
tender passages of his own, stored up in the inviolate strong-box
of his memory, to be unlocked and drawn forth at odd times, may
think he identifies that window whence Sue, safely out of reach,
spoke with Jude, standing down on the footpath, and said,
&ldquo;Oh, my poor friend and comrade, you&rsquo;ll suffer
yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">WIMBORNE MINSTER TO
HORTON AND MONMOUTH ASH</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is by the direct road to
Cranborne, and past the Gate Inn at Clapgate, that one reaches
Horton, where, at the intersection of the two broad main roads
from Wimborne to Cranborne, and from Shaftesbury to Ringwood,
stands Horton Inn, a fine, substantial old house, once depending
upon a great coaching and posting traffic, and even now that only
an occasional cyclist stays the night, dispensing good,
old-fashioned, solid comforts in its cosy and comfortable
rooms.&nbsp; When Horton Inn was built, let us say somewhere
about the time of Queen Anne (who, poor soul! is dead), those who
designed it, disregarding any temptations to be picturesque,
devoted their energies to good, honest workmanship, with the
result that nowadays one sees a building certainly lacking in
imagination, with windows equidistant and each the counterpart of
its fellow, but disclosing in every quoin and keystone, and in
each well and truly laid course of brickwork, the justness and
thoroughness of its design and execution.&nbsp; Within doors it
is the same: unobtrusive but excellent workmanship characterises
panelling and window-sashes, doors and handrails, <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>with the
result that in its old age Horton Inn has an air of distinction
and dignity strongly marked to those who take an interest in
technical details, and attracting the notice of even the least
observant, who from its superior air generally conceive it to be
an old mansion converted to its present use.&nbsp; It is the
subject of an allusion in the tale of <i>Barbara of the House of
Grebe</i>: the &ldquo;Lornton Inn&rdquo; whence Barbara eloped
with the handsome Willowes, and where she was to meet her
disfigured husband, posting along the road from Southampton, on
his return from foreign parts.</p>
<p>The village of Horton, down the road, at some little distance
from the inn, has an oddly German-looking tower to its church,
containing the monument of &ldquo;Squire Hastings&rdquo; of
Woodlands, who died, aged 99 years, in 1650.</p>
<p>On an eerie hillside near by, in what of old was Horton Park,
but sold by the Sturts in 1793 to the Earl of Shaftesbury, and
disparked, stands the many-storied tower of what was once an
observatory built by Humphry Sturt.&nbsp; It is now an empty
shell, through whose ruined windows the wind sighs mournfully at
night, and the moonlight gleams ghostlike.&nbsp; It is an ugly
enough place in daylight, but should you particularly desire to
know what the creepy, uncanny feeling of being haunted is like,
why then, walk up on a windy night to &ldquo;The Folly,&rdquo; as
the villagers call it, and stand in it, listening to the wind
howling, grumbling or whispering in and out of the long,
shaft-like building, and nocturnal birds fluttering and squeaking
on the upper ledges.&nbsp; It is not a little gruesome.</p>
<p>This is one of the originals whence Mr. Hardy <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>drew his
idea of the tower in <i>Two on a Tower</i>, and is certainly the
most impressive of them.&nbsp; Very many years have passed since
the old tower was used, and since the park in which it stands was
converted into a farm.</p>

<p>The Woodlands estate, on the broad acres belonging to the Earl
of Shaftesbury, is a sandy, heathy district of furze and
pine-trees, with a conspicuous ridge in the midst, shaped in a
semicircle and crested with those sombre trees.&nbsp; Here is
Shag Heath and the cultivated oasis called &ldquo;The
Island&rdquo; where on July 8th, 1685, the unfortunate Duke of
Monmouth was captured, hiding amid the bracken and undergrowth,
beneath an ash-tree.&nbsp; He might possibly have succeeded in
stealing away to the coast and so escaping, despite the
thoroughness of the search made by the Sussex Militia, spurred to
it by the reward of &pound;5,000, offered for the capture of the
fugitive, had it not been for the information given by an old
woman who lived in a cottage <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>near at hand.&nbsp; She had seen
him, disguised as a shepherd, threading his way cautiously
through the heath, and he was accordingly discovered near the
spot she had indicated by a militiaman named Parkin.&nbsp; The
Duke, half-starved and unkempt from his hunted wanderings since
the fatal Sedgemoor fight of three days earlier, was found in
possession of his badge of the George, a pocket-book and several
guineas.&nbsp; In his pockets were a number of peas, the remains
of a quantity he had plucked, to stave off his hunger.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 301</span>whose information had directly led
to it, and she received a sum of fifty pounds.</p>
<p>Local tradition points out the spot on the hillside where this
woman&rsquo;s cottage formerly stood, overlooking the field
called &ldquo;Monmouth Close&rdquo; and the horror always felt by
the rustics at the taking of what they still call the
&ldquo;blood-money&rdquo; is seen in the story told of her
after-years.&nbsp; The price of blood brought a curse with
it.&nbsp; She fell upon evil times, and at last lived and died in
a state of rags and dirt, shunned by all.&nbsp; After her death,
the cottage itself speedily earned a sinister reputation, and was
at length either pulled down, or allowed to decay.&nbsp; The spot
is still called locally Louse, or more genteelly Slough,
Lane.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Monmouth Ash&rdquo;&mdash;or &ldquo;Aish,&rdquo; in
the country speech&mdash;still survives, with a difference.&nbsp;
Those who, looking upon the present tree and thinking, despite
its decrepit and propped-up condition, that it cannot be over two
hundred years old&mdash;and therefore that this cannot be the
precise spot&mdash;may, with the reservation already made, be
reassured of its absolute genuineness.&nbsp; The original trunk
grew decayed in the long ago, and was blown down, but the present
tree is a growth from the &ldquo;stool,&rdquo; or root, of that
under which the unhappy Protestant Champion was discovered.</p>

302</span>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">OVER THE HILLS,
BEYOND THE RAINBOW</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Beyond</span> the rainbow is Fairyland,
but no one has ever penetrated to that country, save in dreams,
to which nothing is impossible.&nbsp; There is also a
Rainbow-land in Dorsetshire, certainly not impossible of
achievement, but still a district of which no one knows anything,
saving only those who live in it, and those sturdy fellows, the
carriers, the Marco Polos and Livingstones of this age and
country, who every week or so travel from it to the nearest
market-town, and back again.&nbsp; The carriers are men of
strange speech and dress.&nbsp; Although sturdy, they move slowly
both in body and mind; and their tilt-carts are as slow as
themselves, and as dusty and travel-worn as the caravans of any
African expedition.&nbsp; The Rainbow country of Dorset is, in
fact, a country innocent of railways.&nbsp; It is comprised
within a rough circle made by tracing a course from Bere Regis to
Piddletrenthide, Cerne Abbas, Minterne Magna, Holnest, Sherborne,
Milborne Port, Stalbridge, Sturminster Newton, and Blandford, and
is not only in parts extremely hilly, but includes Bulbarrow, one
of the highest hills in Dorsetshire, 927 feet above sea-level,
and Nettlecombe Tout; among a fine diversified array <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>of lesser
eminences.&nbsp; There is thus some considerable difficulty in
travelling out of it, and a very widespread disinclination to
penetrate into what may, not without considerable warranty, be
termed its &ldquo;wilds.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Wise men, who study maps, and from the tracks of watercourses
deduce easier, or at any rate, rather less arduous, routes, may
find a means of winning to this Rainbow country by turning off
the Piddletown and Bere Regis road at Burlestone, and thence
making along the slight valley of the Chesil Bourne or Divelish
stream.&nbsp; The small village of Dewlish on the map points to
the amazing colonial energy <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>of the Roman, for here, in a
district that even we moderns are accustomed to think remote, was
found a fine Roman pavement, many years ago.&nbsp; In another two
miles and a half the valley closes in, and the neighbourhood of
those big brothers, Bulbarrow and Nettlecombe Tout, is evident
from their smaller kindred, on either hand.</p>
<p>Here, under the shelter of the everlasting hills, and in a
&ldquo;lew&rdquo; warm hollow surrounded by benignant trees that
lovingly shut it in, is Bingham&rsquo;s Melcombe.&nbsp; A little
pebbly brook, the Chesil Bourne, prattles down the combe,
sheep-bells sound from the hillsides, cattle low in the meadows,
and rooks scold and gibber, or lazily caw, in over-arching elms;
otherwise, all is still, for much more than even the rustic
scenes of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s especially farming story,
Bingham&rsquo;s Melcombe is &ldquo;far from the madding
crowd,&rdquo; and there is nothing of it but a farmstead, the
tiny church, and the little gem of an ancient manor-house.&nbsp;
For all that Bingham&rsquo;s Melcombe is so insignificant, it has
sent out at least one distinguished man.&nbsp; Fluellen boasted
that there were &ldquo;good men porn at Monmouth,&rdquo; and here
was born that Sir Richard Bingham who earns the praise of Fuller,
as being &ldquo;a brave soldier and <i>fortis et felix</i> in all
his undertakings.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lies, as a brave soldier
should, but all brave soldiers cannot, in Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; The Binghams of Bingham&rsquo;s Melcombe came from a
younger son of the Binghams of Sutton Bingham in Somersetshire,
and early allied themselves with prominent families.&nbsp; The
ducally crowned lion rampant of the Turbervilles quartered on
their ancestral shield owes its place there to the marriage <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>of Robert
Bingham, about the reign of Henry III., or Edward I., with the
daughter and heiress of Robert Turberville.</p>
<p>These long-descended Binghams maintained their hold upon this
lovely old home of theirs from the middle of the thirteenth
century until recently.&nbsp; Now it has passed into other
hands.&nbsp; A member of the family, Canon Bingham, was the
original of the &ldquo;Parson Tringham,&rdquo; the learned
antiquary, who, in the opening pages of <i>Tess of the
D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>, so indiscreetly informs old John
Durbeyfield, the haggler, of his distinguished ancestry.</p>
<p>The manor-house of Bingham&rsquo;s Melcombe, within its
courtyard, is a perfect example of a sixteenth-century country
residence.&nbsp; The courtyard, entered by a gatehouse, discloses
stone-gabled buildings at the sides, with the highly carved and
decorated projecting gable of the hall in front; displaying with
a wealth of mantling the Bingham coat of arms, the whole
overgrown with trailing roses.</p>
<p>A wild, chalky country, very knobbly and with constant hills
and dales, leads away to westward, past Melcombe Horsey, to the
hamlet and starved hillside farms of Plush, where flints abound,
water is scarce, and farmers are obliged to depend largely upon
the &ldquo;dew-ponds&rdquo; made on the arid downs.&nbsp; Here is
Dole&rsquo;s Ash farm, the original of &ldquo;Flintcomb
Ash,&rdquo; the &ldquo;starve-acre place&rdquo; where Tess toiled
among the other weariful hands in the great swede-fields,
&ldquo;a hundred odd acres in one patch,&rdquo; with not a tree
in sight: Rainbow-land is not all fertile and roseate.&nbsp; The
farm, as Mr. Hardy describes it, is situated &ldquo;above stony
<a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>lanchets&mdash;the outcrop of siliceous veins in the
chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in
bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes,&rdquo; and is at the other
extreme from the fertility and sheltered beauty of the Valley of
the Frome, the &ldquo;Vale of Great Dairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very different from the forbidding westerly range from
Bingham&rsquo;s Melcombe is the country immediately to the
east.&nbsp; There the village of Milton Abbas lies enfolded
between the richly wooded hills, where the little Mill Bourne
rises, at the foot of an alarming but wonderfully picturesque
descent; and the woodland shade comes to the back door of every
cottage.</p>
<p>Milton Abbas is a remarkable place, and owes its long lines of
regularly spaced cottages, all of the same design, to the
autocratic whim of Joseph Damer, Baron Milton and first Earl of
Dorchester, who (then a commoner) purchased the large and
beautiful estate in 1752, and, demolishing the old village, which
rose humbly on the outskirts of the magnificent abbey, rebuilt
it, a mile away, in 1786.&nbsp; Milton Abbas is, indeed, the
precursor of many recent &ldquo;model&rdquo; villages, and
typical of the highhanded ways of the eighteenth-century landed
gentry, who could not endure the sight of a cottage from the
windows of their mansions; and so forthwith, in the manner of
Eastern potentates, whisked whole villages and populations away
from between the wind and their gentility.&nbsp; Each cottage is
built four-square, with thatched roof and equidistant doors and
windows, all in the Doll&rsquo;s House or Noah&rsquo;s Ark order
of architecture, and there is scarce a pin to choose between any
of them.&nbsp; Half-way down <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>the street is the almshouse, and
opposite is the church, and from their presence it will be seen
that Lord Dorchester&rsquo;s village-transplanting was complete
and highly methodical.&nbsp; Now that time has weathered his
model village, and the chestnut trees planted between the
cottages have grown up, Milton Abbas is a not unpleasing
curiosity.</p>

</a></p>
<p>But Milton Park, beyond the village, contains the greatest
surprise, in the almost perfect condition of the surviving abbey
church, rising in all the stately bulk and beautiful elaboration
of a cathedral; beside the great mansion built for Lord
Dorchester in 1771 by Sir William Chambers, familiar to Londoners
as the architect of Somerset House.</p>

<p>That explorer of this Wessex unknown country, this Land Beyond
the Rainbow, who, setting forth uninstructed in what he shall
find, comes all unwittingly upon this generally unheard-of abbey,
is greatly to be envied, for it is to him as much of a surprise
as though its existence had never been <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>breathed
beyond the rim of the hills down in whose hollows it lies hid;
and to him falls the exquisite pleasure of what is nothing less
than a discovery.&nbsp; Coming into the park, all unsuspectingly,
the abbey church is disclosed against a wooded background of
hills, strikingly like the first glimpse of Wells Cathedral,
underneath the Mendips.</p>
<p>Milton Abbey, the &ldquo;Middleton Abbey&rdquo; of <i>The
Woodlanders</i>, was founded so early as <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 933, by Athelstan, and in thirty
years from that date became a Benedictine monastery.&nbsp;
Nothing, however, of that early time has survived, and the great
building we now see belongs to the period between 1322 and 1492,
when it was gradually rebuilt, after having been struck by
lightning and wholly destroyed in 1309.&nbsp; But the noble
building rising so beautifully from the gravel drives and trim
lawns of this park is but a completed portion of an intended
design.&nbsp; It consists of choir, tower, and north and south
transepts, and extends a total length of 132 feet.&nbsp; Had not
the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 put an end to this
lovely retreat of the Benedictine fraternity, a nave would have
been added.&nbsp; To Sir John Tregonwell, King&rsquo;s Proctor in
the divorce of Henry VIII. and Katherine of Aragon, fell what may
reasonably be called this fine piece of &ldquo;spoil&rdquo;; for
the price of one thousand pounds at which he bought the monkish
estates of Milton Abbas can scarce be regarded as adequate
purchase money.&nbsp; Coming at last into the hands of Joseph
Damer, the domestic offices of the monastery, which had until
then survived in almost perfect condition, were with one
exception utterly destroyed, and the existing mansion built in a
<a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>bastard
&ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; style, as understood by Chambers.&nbsp; The
sole exception is the grand Abbot&rsquo;s Hall, enshrined within
that eighteenth-century building, and entered from the farther
side of the great quadrangle.&nbsp; Now in use as a drawing-room,
there is probably no more stately room of that description in
existence.&nbsp; It has the combined interest and beauty of size,
loftiness and exquisite workmanship in stone and carved wood,
with antiquity.</p>

</a>The abbey church stands immediately to the south of the
mansion, separated from it only by lawns and a drive, and is used
as a chapel by the present owner of the estate, a nephew of the
late Baron Hambro, who restored it at great cost under the
professional advice of that arch-restorer, Sir Gilbert
Scott.&nbsp; The solitude, the size and beauty of the interior,
are very impressive.&nbsp; Here is a place of worship like a
cathedral, used for the prayers of a private household, and if
you can by any means manage to forget the grotesque <a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>disproportion of ancient size and magnificence to
modern use, you will feel very reverent indeed.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There is a monument here to that fortunate and successful
time-server, Sir John Tregonwell, who so neatly trimmed the sails
of his public conduct in those times of quick-change, between the
reigns of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, that, although a Roman
Catholic, he managed to enrich himself at the expense of the old
religion&rsquo;s misfortunes, and to die at peace with all men,
although in the possession of property belonging to others.&nbsp;
There is also a most exquisitely sculptured marble monument by
Carlini to Lady Milton, who died in 1775.&nbsp; It represents her
in the costume of that period, with her husband bending anxiously
over her.&nbsp; A quaint little piece of Gothic fancy will be
seen on one of the walls, in the shape of the sculptured rebus of
one Abbot William Middleton, with the Arabic date, 1514, and the
device of a mill on a tun, or barrel.&nbsp; Thus did the
strenuous minds of the Middle Ages unbend to childish fancies and
puns in stone.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A sign of the times may be noted, in the restoration and
re-dedication of the long-desecrated Chapel of St. Catherine, on
the hilltop to the east of the abbey.&nbsp; When the monastery
was dissolved, the chapel of course fell out of use, and so
remained until recently.&nbsp; It had in turn been used as a
pigeon-house, a labourer&rsquo;s cottage, a carpenter&rsquo;s
shop, and a lumber-room, and was falling into complete decay when
Mr. Everard Hambro in 1903 <a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>decided to restore it.&nbsp; The
varied Saxon, Norman, and Perpendicular architecture was
accordingly repaired, and the building reconsecrated on St.
Catherine&rsquo;s night of the same year.</p>
<p>Through Winterborne Houghton, and Winterborne Stickland, two
of the eleven Dorsetshire Winterbornes, named from a chalk stream
that flows into the Stour at Sturminster Marshall, we come to
another <i>Woodlanders</i> landmark, Turnworth House, the
&ldquo;Great Hintock House,&rdquo; where Mrs. Charmond,
fascinator of the surgeon Fitzpiers, lived.&nbsp; It is situated
just as in the tale, in a deep and lonely dell:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To describe it as standing in a hollow
would not express the situation of the manor-house; it stood in a
hole.&nbsp; But the hole was full of beauty.&nbsp; From the spot
which Grace had reached a stone could easily have been thrown
over or into the birds&rsquo;-nested chimneys of the
mansion.&nbsp; Its walls were surmounted by a battlemented
parapet; but the grey lead roofs were quite visible behind it,
with their gutters, laps, rolls, and skylights. . . .&nbsp; The
front of the house was an ordinary manorial presentation of
Elizabethan windows, mullioned and hooded, worked in rich
snuff-coloured freestone from local quarries. . . .&nbsp; Above
the house was a dense plantation, the roots of whose trees were
above the level of the chimneys.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Turnworth the way out of Rainbow-land by way of
Durweston, Stourpaine, and Blandford is easy: a <i>facilis
descensus</i>, as well in spirit as in the matter of gradients,
for thus you come out of the untravelled and the unknown into the
well-worn tracks and intimate life of every day.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
